  "summary": "The `FeatureProposalInstruction` code in the Solana Program Library is responsible for managing feature proposals within the Solana ecosystem. It provides two primary instructions: `Propose` and `Tally`.\n\nThe `Propose` instruction is used to create a new feature proposal. It creates several accounts, including a token mint, a distributor token account, an acceptance token account, and a feature ID account. The proposer is expected to distribute the tokens in the distributor token account to all participating parties. The proposal is considered eligible for acceptance if the required number of tokens (`AcceptanceCriteria::tokens_required`) are transferred into the acceptance token account before the deadline (`AcceptanceCriteria::deadline`).\n\nHere's an example of creating a `Propose` instruction:\n\n```rust\nlet instruction = propose(\n    &funding_address,\n    &feature_proposal_address,\n    tokens_to_mint,\n    acceptance_criteria,\n);\n```\n\nThe `Tally` instruction is a permission-less instruction that checks the acceptance criteria for a feature proposal. It can result in no action, feature proposal acceptance, or feature proposal expiration. Any party can execute the `Tally` instruction to complete the feature acceptance process.\n\nHere's an example of creating a `Tally` instruction:\n\n```rust\nlet instruction = tally(&feature_proposal_address);\n```\n\nThe code also provides helper functions for generating addresses related to the feature proposal, such as `get_mint_address`, `get_distributor_token_address`, `get_acceptance_token_address`, and `get_feature_id_address`.\n\nIn summary, this code is responsible for managing feature proposals in the Solana ecosystem by providing instructions to create proposals and tally their acceptance criteria.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `FeatureProposalInstruction` enum and its variants?\n   **Answer**: The `FeatureProposalInstruction` enum represents the instructions supported by the Feature Proposal program. It has two variants: `Propose` and `Tally`. The `Propose` variant is used to propose a new feature, while the `Tally` variant is a permission-less instruction to check the acceptance criteria for the feature proposal, which may result in no action, feature proposal acceptance, or feature proposal expiration.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `propose()` function work and what are its parameters?\n   **Answer**: The `propose()` function is used to create a `FeatureProposalInstruction::Propose` instruction. It takes four parameters: `funding_address`, `feature_proposal_address`, `tokens_to_mint`, and `acceptance_criteria`. The function sets up the necessary account metadata and data for the instruction, and returns an `Instruction` object with the provided parameters.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `tally()` function and how does it work?\n   **Answer**: The `tally()` function is used to create a `FeatureProposalInstruction::Tally` instruction. It takes a single parameter, `feature_proposal_address`. The function sets up the necessary account metadata for the instruction and returns an `Instruction` object with the `Tally` variant of `FeatureProposalInstruction`."
