  "summary": "This code provides two mathematical approximation functions, `sqrt` and `f32_normal_cdf`, which are used for calculating the square root and the normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a given number, respectively.\n\nThe `sqrt` function calculates the square root of a given number using an algorithm based on the implementation found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Binary_numeral_system_(base_2)). It takes a generic type `T` as input, which must implement the `PrimInt`, `CheckedShl`, and `CheckedShr` traits. The function returns an `Option<T>` containing the square root of the input number, or `None` if the input is negative.\n\n```rust\nlet radicand: u64 = 16;\nlet result = sqrt(radicand); // Some(4)\n```\n\nThe `f32_normal_cdf` function calculates the normal CDF of a given `f32` number using an approximation that is accurate to 3 digits. The algorithm is based on the implementation found in [this paper](https://www.hrpub.org/download/20140305/MS7-13401470.pdf). The function takes an `f32` argument and returns an `f32` result.\n\n```rust\nlet argument: f32 = 1.0;\nlet result = f32_normal_cdf(argument); // 0.8413\n```\n\nThe code also includes tests for both functions using the `proptest` crate. The tests check the correctness of the functions by comparing their results with known correct values or bounds. For example, the `check_square_root` function tests the `sqrt` function by ensuring that the result is within the correct range, while the `check_normal_cdf_f32` function tests the `f32_normal_cdf` function by comparing its result with the value calculated using the `libm::erff` function.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `sqrt` function and how does it work?\n   \n   **Answer**: The `sqrt` function calculates the square root of a given number. It is an implementation of the algorithm described in [Methods of computing square roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Binary_numeral_system_(base_2)). The function takes a generic type `T` that implements `PrimInt`, `CheckedShl`, and `CheckedShr` traits, and returns an `Option<T>` containing the square root of the input number.\n\n2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `f32_normal_cdf` function and how does it work?\n\n   **Answer**: The `f32_normal_cdf` function calculates the normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a given number. The approximation is accurate to 3 digits. The function takes a `f32` argument and returns a `f32` result. The algorithm is based on the implementation described in the paper [A New Algorithm for Calculating Normal Distribution Function](https://www.hrpub.org/download/20140305/MS7-13401470.pdf).\n\n3. **Question**: How are the tests structured for the `sqrt` and `f32_normal_cdf` functions?\n\n   **Answer**: The tests for both functions are located in the `tests` module. For the `sqrt` function, there are tests for minimum and maximum values, as well as property-based tests using the `proptest` crate. For the `f32_normal_cdf` function, there are tests for minimum and maximum values, and property-based tests with a range of -1000 to 1000."
