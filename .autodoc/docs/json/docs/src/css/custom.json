  "summary": "This code is a global CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file for the Solana Program Library project. It is responsible for defining the styling and appearance of the project's website, which is built using the Docusaurus framework. Docusaurus is a popular open-source framework for building content-centric websites, and it uses the Infima CSS framework by default.\n\nThe code starts by importing the Roboto font from Google Fonts and then overrides the default Infima variables to customize the appearance of the website. It sets custom colors for primary elements, font sizes, spacing, and the base font family. Additionally, it defines a custom background color for the footer.\n\nNext, the code defines a `@keyframes` animation called `fadeInUp`, which animates elements from an initial state of opacity 0 and a slight downward translation to their final position with full opacity. This animation is used to create a smooth appearance effect for elements on the page.\n\nThe `main` element is given a margin to provide spacing around the main content area. The `.docusaurus-highlight-code-line` class is used to style highlighted lines of code within the documentation, giving them a distinct background color and padding.\n\nThe `.card` class is used to style card elements on the website. It applies padding, margin, and a box-shadow to create a visually appealing card layout. The `fadeInUp` animation is applied to the cards, and a hover effect is added to create a subtle lift effect when the user hovers over a card.\n\nLastly, the code customizes the appearance of the footer by applying a dark background color and adding padding to the text within the footer. This ensures a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the Solana Program Library website.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `:root` block in the CSS file?**\n\n   The `:root` block is used to define global CSS variables that can be used throughout the entire stylesheet. In this case, it sets various color, font, and spacing variables for the project.\n\n2. **What is the `@keyframes fadeInUp` animation used for?**\n\n   The `@keyframes fadeInUp` animation is used to create a fade-in effect with a slight upward movement. It starts with 0% opacity and a translateY of 1.5rem, and it can be applied to elements to create a smooth entrance animation.\n\n3. **How does the `.card:hover` style affect the appearance of the card element?**\n\n   The `.card:hover` style applies a transform effect to the card element when the user hovers over it. It moves the card element 5 pixels upwards, giving a subtle lift effect to indicate interactivity."
