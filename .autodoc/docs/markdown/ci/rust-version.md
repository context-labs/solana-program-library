This script is responsible for managing Rust versions used in the Solana Program Library project. It sets up the environment variables for both stable and nightly Rust versions and provides a way to install or update the Rust toolchain as needed.

The script first checks if the `RUST_STABLE_VERSION` and `RUST_NIGHTLY_VERSION` environment variables are set. If not, it reads the stable version from the `rust-toolchain.toml` file and sets the nightly version to a specific date (e.g., `2022-04-01`).

It then exports the environment variables `rust_stable`, `rust_stable_docker_image`, `rust_nightly`, and `rust_nightly_docker_image` for use in other scripts or commands.

To use this script, you can source it with different arguments:

- `source ci/rust-version.sh all`: Update both stable and nightly Rust toolchains.
- `source ci/rust-version.sh stable`: Update only the stable Rust toolchain.
- `source ci/rust-version.sh nightly`: Update only the nightly Rust toolchain.

After sourcing the script, you can build the project with either the stable or nightly Rust version using the following commands:

```bash
$ cargo +"$rust_stable" build
$ cargo +"$rust_nightly" build
```

The script also includes a `rustup_install` function that installs the specified Rust toolchain if it's not already installed. This function is called based on the argument passed to the script (e.g., `stable`, `nightly`, or `all`).
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of this script?
   **Answer:** This script is used to manage Rust versions for the Solana Program Library project. It sets environment variables for stable and nightly Rust versions, and provides a way to install the required Rust toolchains for the project.

2. **Question:** How can I use this script to update both stable and nightly Rust versions?
   **Answer:** To update both stable and nightly Rust versions, you can run `source ci/rust-version.sh all`.

3. **Question:** How can I build the project using the stable or nightly Rust version set by this script?
   **Answer:** After sourcing the script, you can build the project using the stable Rust version with `cargo +"$rust_stable" build` or the nightly Rust version with `cargo +"$rust_nightly" build`.
