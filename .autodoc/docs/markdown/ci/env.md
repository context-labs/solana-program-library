This code is a shell script that normalizes Continuous Integration (CI) environment variables for the Solana Program Library project. The purpose of this script is to provide a consistent set of environment variables across different CI platforms, such as Travis CI, Buildkite, AppVeyor, and GitHub Actions. This allows the project to easily switch between CI platforms or use multiple platforms simultaneously without having to modify the build scripts.

The script first checks if the `$CI` variable is set, indicating that it is running in a CI environment. If it is, the script proceeds to set a series of environment variables based on the specific CI platform being used. These variables include:

- `CI_BRANCH`: The branch being built.
- `CI_BASE_BRANCH`: The base branch for pull requests.
- `CI_BUILD_ID`: The build identifier.
- `CI_COMMIT`: The commit hash being built.
- `CI_JOB_ID`: The job identifier.
- `CI_PULL_REQUEST`: Whether the build is for a pull request.
- `CI_OS_NAME`: The operating system of the build environment.
- `CI_REPO_SLUG`: The repository slug (owner/repo).
- `CI_TAG`: The tag being built, if applicable.

For each CI platform, the script sets these variables based on the platform-specific environment variables. For example, in Travis CI, it sets `CI_BRANCH` to `$TRAVIS_BRANCH`, `CI_COMMIT` to `$TRAVIS_COMMIT`, and so on. The script also handles some platform-specific quirks, such as the way Buildkite triggers PR builds and propagates tags.

Finally, the script prints the values of the normalized environment variables, which can be used by other build scripts in the project. If the script is not running in a CI environment, it sets all the variables to empty values.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of this script?
   **Answer:** This script is used to normalize Continuous Integration (CI) environment variables across different CI platforms (Travis, Buildkite, Appveyor, and GitHub Actions) for the solana-program-library project.

2. **Question:** How does the script handle different CI platforms?
   **Answer:** The script checks for the presence of specific environment variables (e.g., `$TRAVIS`, `$BUILDKITE`, `$APPVEYOR`, `$GITHUB_ACTIONS`) to determine the current CI platform and then sets normalized environment variables accordingly.

3. **Question:** What are the normalized environment variables that this script sets?
   **Answer:** The script sets the following normalized environment variables: `CI`, `CI_BRANCH`, `CI_BUILD_ID`, `CI_COMMIT`, `CI_JOB_ID`, `CI_OS_NAME`, `CI_PULL_REQUEST`, `CI_REPO_SLUG`, and `CI_TAG`.
