This code provides utility functions for the Solana Program Library, specifically for handling common assertions related to public keys and account ownership. These utility functions help ensure that certain conditions are met before executing specific operations within the larger project.

1. `assert_keys_equal(key1: Pubkey, key2: Pubkey) -> ProgramResult`: This function checks if two given public keys are equal. If they are not equal, it returns an error `BinaryOptionError::PublicKeyMismatch`. This function can be used to ensure that two public keys match before performing an operation that requires them to be the same.

   Example usage:
   ```
   assert_keys_equal(pubkey1, pubkey2)?;
   ```

2. `assert_keys_unequal(key1: Pubkey, key2: Pubkey) -> ProgramResult`: This function checks if two given public keys are not equal. If they are equal, it returns an error `BinaryOptionError::PublicKeysShouldBeUnique`. This function can be used to ensure that two public keys are unique before performing an operation that requires them to be different.

   Example usage:
   ```
   assert_keys_unequal(pubkey1, pubkey2)?;
   ```

3. `assert_initialized<T: Pack + IsInitialized>(account_info: &AccountInfo) -> Result<T, ProgramError>`: This function checks if an account is initialized by unpacking the account data and calling the `is_initialized()` method on it. If the account is not initialized, it returns an error `BinaryOptionError::UninitializedAccount`. This function can be used to ensure that an account is initialized before performing an operation that requires it to be initialized.

   Example usage:
   ```
   let account = assert_initialized::<AccountType>(&account_info)?;
   ```

4. `assert_owned_by(account: &AccountInfo, owner: &Pubkey) -> ProgramResult`: This function checks if an account is owned by a specific public key. If the account owner does not match the provided public key, it returns an error `BinaryOptionError::IncorrectOwner`. This function can be used to ensure that an account is owned by a specific public key before performing an operation that requires it to be owned by that key.

   Example usage:
   ```
   assert_owned_by(&account_info, &expected_owner)?;
   ```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `assert_keys_equal` and `assert_keys_unequal` functions?
   **Answer**: These functions are utility functions that check if two given public keys are equal or not equal, respectively. They return a `ProgramResult` which is either an error (if the condition is not met) or an `Ok(())` if the condition is met.

2. **Question**: What is the `assert_initialized` function used for?
   **Answer**: The `assert_initialized` function is used to check if an account is initialized or not. It takes an `AccountInfo` reference and returns a `Result` containing either the unpacked account data of type `T` if the account is initialized, or a `ProgramError` if the account is not initialized.

3. **Question**: How does the `assert_owned_by` function work?
   **Answer**: The `assert_owned_by` function checks if a given account is owned by a specific public key. It takes an `AccountInfo` reference and a `Pubkey` reference as input, and returns a `ProgramResult`. If the account's owner is equal to the provided public key, it returns `Ok(())`, otherwise, it returns an error indicating the incorrect owner.
