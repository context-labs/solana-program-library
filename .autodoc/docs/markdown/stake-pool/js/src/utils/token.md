This code is responsible for managing token accounts and mints in the Solana Program Library. It provides utility functions to interact with token accounts and mints, which are essential components in the Solana ecosystem for managing tokens.

The `getTokenMint` function retrieves the `MintInfo` of a given token mint by its public key. It creates a new `Token` instance and calls the `getMintInfo()` method to fetch the mint information.

```javascript
export async function getTokenMint(
  connection: Connection,
  tokenMintPubkey: PublicKey,
): Promise<MintInfo | undefined> {
  // ...
}
```

The `addAssociatedTokenAccount` function retrieves the associated token account for a given owner and mint, or creates one if it doesn't exist. It first calculates the associated address and checks if the account exists. If not, it creates an instruction to create the associated token account and calculates the rent fee.

```javascript
export async function addAssociatedTokenAccount(
  connection: Connection,
  owner: PublicKey,
  mint: PublicKey,
  instructions: TransactionInstruction[],
) {
  // ...
}
```

The `getTokenAccount` function retrieves the token account information for a given token account address and expected token mint. It checks if the account exists and if the mint matches the expected mint. If both conditions are met, it returns the token account information.

```javascript
export async function getTokenAccount(
  connection: Connection,
  tokenAccountAddress: PublicKey,
  expectedTokenMint: PublicKey,
): Promise<AccountInfo | void> {
  // ...
}
```

These utility functions can be used in the larger project to manage token accounts and mints, enabling developers to interact with tokens on the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `getTokenMint` function and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `getTokenMint` function is used to get the mint information of a token with a given public key. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `MintInfo` object or `undefined`.

2. **Question**: How does the `addAssociatedTokenAccount` function work and what does it return?
   **Answer**: The `addAssociatedTokenAccount` function retrieves the associated token account for a given owner and mint, or creates one if it doesn't exist. It returns an object containing the associated address and the rent fee.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `getTokenAccount` function and what are its expected inputs?
   **Answer**: The `getTokenAccount` function is used to get the token account information for a given token account address and expected token mint. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `AccountInfo` object or `void`.
