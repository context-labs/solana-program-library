The code in this file is part of the Solana Program Library and provides a set of utility functions and classes for interacting with a stake pool on the Solana blockchain. A stake pool is a smart contract that allows users to pool their stakes together and delegate them to validators, earning rewards in the process.

The main exported classes and functions in this file are:

- `StakePoolAccounts`: A wrapper class for a stake pool, containing the stake pool account and validator list account.
- `getStakePoolAccount`: Retrieves and deserializes a StakePool account using a web3js connection and the stake pool address.
- `getStakeAccount`: Retrieves and deserializes a Stake account using a web3js connection and the stake address.
- `getStakePoolAccounts`: Retrieves all StakePool and ValidatorList accounts that are running a particular StakePool program.
- `depositStake`: Creates instructions required to deposit stake to stake pool.
- `depositSol`: Creates instructions required to deposit sol to stake pool.
- `withdrawStake`: Creates instructions required to withdraw stake from a stake pool.
- `withdrawSol`: Creates instructions required to withdraw SOL directly from a stake pool.
- `increaseValidatorStake`: Creates instructions required to increase validator stake.
- `decreaseValidatorStake`: Creates instructions required to decrease validator stake.
- `updateStakePool`: Creates instructions required to completely update a stake pool after epoch change.
- `stakePoolInfo`: Retrieves detailed information about the StakePool.
- `redelegate`: Creates instructions required
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `StakePoolAccounts` interface?**

   The `StakePoolAccounts` interface is a wrapper class for a stake pool, which contains a stake pool account and a validator list account. It is used to represent the accounts associated with a stake pool in the Solana Program Library.

2. **How does the `depositStake` function work?**

   The `depositStake` function creates instructions required to deposit stake to a stake pool. It takes parameters such as the connection, stake pool address, authorized public key, validator vote, deposit stake, and an optional pool token receiver account. It returns an object containing the instructions, signers, and rent fee for the deposit operation.

3. **What is the purpose of the `getStakePoolAccounts` function?**

   The `getStakePoolAccounts` function retrieves and deserializes all StakePool and ValidatorList accounts that are running a particular StakePool program. It takes an active web3js connection and the stake pool program address as parameters and returns an array of StakePoolAccount or ValidatorListAccount objects, or undefined if no accounts are found.
