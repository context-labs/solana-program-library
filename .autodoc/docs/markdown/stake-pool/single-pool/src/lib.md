The code provided is part of a program for liquid staking with a single validator in the Solana Program Library. Liquid staking allows users to stake their tokens with a validator and receive a liquid token in return, which can be traded or used in other DeFi applications.

The code defines several constants and utility functions to find and generate addresses for various components of the liquid staking program, such as the pool stake, pool authority, and pool mint addresses. These addresses are derived from the program ID and the vote account address, using a combination of prefixes and the `find_address_and_bump` function.

For example, the `find_pool_stake_address` function returns the canonical stake account address for a given vote account:

```rust
pub fn find_pool_stake_address(program_id: &Pubkey, vote_account_address: &Pubkey) -> Pubkey {
    find_pool_stake_address_and_bump(program_id, vote_account_address).0
}
```

Similarly, the `find_pool_authority_address` and `find_pool_mint_address` functions return the canonical authority and token mint addresses, respectively.

The code also defines a function `find_default_deposit_account_address` to find the address of the default intermediate account that holds activating user stake before deposit. This function takes the vote account address and user wallet address as input parameters and returns the derived deposit account address.

These utility functions are essential for the proper functioning of the liquid staking program, as they help in managing the addresses for various components and ensuring that the program interacts with the correct accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `XXX TODO FIXME` comment and how should the private keys for on-chain programs be handled?
   **Answer**: The `XXX TODO FIXME` comment is a placeholder indicating that the current implementation needs to be changed or updated. The proper handling of private keys for on-chain programs depends on the company's security policies and best practices, which should be consulted to determine the appropriate approach.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `POOL_STAKE_PREFIX`, `POOL_AUTHORITY_PREFIX`, and `POOL_MINT_PREFIX` constants?
   **Answer**: These constants are used as prefixes for generating program addresses related to pool stake, pool authority, and pool mint, respectively. They help in organizing and differentiating between different types of addresses within the program.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `find_address_and_bump` function and how is it used in the other `find_*_address_and_bump` functions?
   **Answer**: The `find_address_and_bump` function is a utility function that finds a program address and its corresponding bump value based on the provided prefix and vote account address. It is used by the other `find_*_address_and_bump` functions to generate the pool stake, pool authority, and pool mint addresses along with their bump values.
