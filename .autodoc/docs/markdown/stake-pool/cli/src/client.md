This code provides utility functions to interact with the Solana blockchain, specifically for managing stake pools and their associated accounts. The functions are designed to work with the `solana-program-library` project, which provides a set of Solana programs for various use cases.

The `get_stake_pool` function retrieves the `StakePool` data from a given stake pool address. Similarly, the `get_validator_list` function retrieves the `ValidatorList` data from a given validator list address. Both functions use the `RpcClient` to fetch account data and deserialize it into the respective structures.

The `get_token_account` function retrieves the token account data for a given token account address and checks if the token mint matches the expected token mint. If the mint matches, it returns the token account data; otherwise, it returns an error. The `get_token_mint` function retrieves the token mint data for a given token mint address.

The `get_stake_state` function retrieves the stake state data for a given stake address. It uses the `RpcClient` to fetch account data and deserialize it into the `stake::state::StakeState` structure.

The `get_stake_pools` function retrieves a list of all stake pools, their associated validator lists, and their withdraw authority addresses. It filters the accounts by the stake pool program ID and account type, then deserializes the account data into the `StakePool` and `ValidatorList` structures.

The `get_all_stake` function retrieves all stake accounts associated with a given authorized staker. It filters the accounts by the stake program ID and the authorized staker's public key, then returns a set of stake account addresses.

These utility functions can be used in the larger project to manage and interact with stake pools, validator lists, token accounts, and token mints on the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_stake_pool` function and what does it return?

   **Answer:** The `get_stake_pool` function retrieves the stake pool data from a given stake pool address using the `RpcClient`. It returns a `Result` containing a `StakePool` object if successful, or an `Error` if there is an issue with the stake pool data.

2. **Question:** How does the `get_all_stake` function filter the stake accounts?

   **Answer:** The `get_all_stake` function filters the stake accounts by the `Meta::authorized::staker` field, which begins at byte offset 12. It uses the `RpcFilterType::Memcmp` filter with the base58 encoded `authorized_staker` public key as the filter value.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_validator_list` function and what does it return?

   **Answer:** The `get_validator_list` function retrieves the validator list data from a given validator list address using the `RpcClient`. It returns a `Result` containing a `ValidatorList` object if successful, or an `Error` if there is an issue with the validator list data.
