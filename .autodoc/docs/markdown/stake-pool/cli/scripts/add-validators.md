This script is used to add new validators to a stake pool in the Solana Program Library project. It takes two input arguments: the stake pool keyfile and a file containing a list of validator vote account public keys. The script is written in Bash and is designed to be executed in a Unix-based environment.

The main function of the script is `add_validator_stakes()`, which takes two arguments: the stake pool public key and the file containing the validator vote account addresses. The function reads each validator address from the file and adds it to the stake pool using the `spl-stake-pool add-validator` command.

The script first sets the working directory to the location of the script itself using `cd "$(dirname "$0")" || exit`. It then assigns the input arguments to the variables `stake_pool_keyfile` and `validator_list`.

The `spl_stake_pool` variable is set to `spl-stake-pool` by default, but can be changed to use a local build by uncommenting the line `#spl_stake_pool=../../../target/debug/spl-stake-pool`.

The stake pool public key is obtained using the `solana-keygen pubkey` command with the stake pool keyfile as an argument. The script then calls the `add_validator_stakes()` function with the stake pool public key and the validator list file as arguments.

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```bash
./add_validators.sh stake_pool_keyfile.json validator_list.txt
```

In this example, `stake_pool_keyfile.json` is the stake pool keyfile and `validator_list.txt` is a file containing a list of validator vote account addresses. The script will add each validator from the list to the stake pool.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of this script?
   **Answer:** The purpose of this script is to add new validators to a stake pool, given the stake pool keyfile and a file listing validator vote account pubkeys.

2. **Question:** How does the script read the validator vote account addresses?
   **Answer:** The script reads the validator vote account addresses from a file specified by the `validator_list` variable, which is passed as the second argument to the script.

3. **Question:** How does the script add a validator to the stake pool?
   **Answer:** The script adds a validator to the stake pool by calling the `$spl_stake_pool add-validator` command with the stake pool and validator pubkey as arguments, inside the `add_validator_stakes` function.
