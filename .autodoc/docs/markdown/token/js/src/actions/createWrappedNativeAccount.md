The `createWrappedNativeAccount` function in this code is responsible for creating, initializing, and funding a new wrapped native SOL (Solana) account. This is useful in the Solana ecosystem when users want to interact with tokens other than SOL, such as SPL tokens, which require a wrapped native SOL account.

The function takes the following parameters:

- `connection`: Connection to the Solana network
- `payer`: The signer responsible for paying transaction and initialization fees
- `owner`: The owner of the new token account
- `amount`: The number of lamports (smallest unit of SOL) to wrap
- `keypair`: Optional keypair, defaulting to the associated token account for the native mint and `owner`
- `confirmOptions`: Options for confirming the transaction
- `programId`: SPL Token program account (default: `TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`)
- `nativeMint`: Native mint (default: `NATIVE_MINT`)

The function first checks if the provided `amount` is 0 or NaN. If so, it creates the account without funding it using the `createAccount` function. If a `keypair` is not provided, the function creates the account at the owner's associated token account (ATA) for the native mint and returns its address. It does this by creating a new transaction with the `createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction`, `SystemProgram.transfer`, and `createSyncNativeInstruction` instructions.

If a `keypair` is provided, the function creates the account with the provided keypair and returns its public key. It does this by creating a new transaction with the `SystemProgram.createAccount`, `SystemProgram.transfer`, and `createInitializeAccountInstruction` instructions.

Finally, the function sends and confirms the transaction using the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function and returns the public key of the new wrapped native SOL account.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `createWrappedNativeAccount` function and what are its input parameters?
   **Answer**: The `createWrappedNativeAccount` function is used to create, initialize, and fund a new wrapped native SOL account. The input parameters are the connection to use, the payer of the transaction and initialization fees, the owner of the new token account, the number of lamports to wrap, an optional keypair, optional confirm options, and optional programId and nativeMint.

2. **Question**: How does the function handle the case when the amount provided is 0 or NaN?
   **Answer**: If the amount provided is explicitly 0 or NaN, the function will create the account without funding it by calling the `createAccount` function.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `getAssociatedTokenAddressSync` function and how is it used in this code?
   **Answer**: The `getAssociatedTokenAddressSync` function is used to get the associated token address for the native mint and the owner. In this code, it is used to create the account at the owner's associated token account (ATA) for the native mint and return its address.
