The `mintToChecked` function in this code is responsible for minting tokens to a specified account while asserting the token mint and decimals. This function is part of the Solana Program Library, which provides a set of utilities and tools for working with the Solana blockchain.

The function takes the following parameters:

- `connection`: A Connection object to interact with the Solana network.
- `payer`: A Signer object representing the payer of the transaction fees.
- `mint`: A PublicKey object representing the mint for the account.
- `destination`: A PublicKey object representing the address of the account to mint tokens to.
- `authority`: A Signer or PublicKey object representing the minting authority.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to mint, as a number or bigint.
- `decimals`: The number of decimals in the amount to mint.
- `multiSigners`: An optional array of Signer objects for signing accounts if the `authority` is a multisig.
- `confirmOptions`: Optional options for confirming the transaction.
- `programId`: An optional parameter representing the SPL Token program account, defaulting to `TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`.

The function first calls the `getSigners` function to obtain the authority public key and an array of signers. It then creates a new `Transaction` object and adds a `createMintToCheckedInstruction` to the transaction. The `createMintToCheckedInstruction` function is responsible for creating the actual minting instruction with the provided parameters.

Finally, the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function is called to send the transaction to the Solana network and confirm its execution. The function returns the signature of the confirmed transaction as a `TransactionSignature` object.

Here's an example of how to use the `mintToChecked` function:

```javascript
import { Connection, Keypair, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { mintToChecked } from 'solana-program-library';

const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
const payer = Keypair.fromSecretKey(/* secret key bytes */);
const mint = new PublicKey('mint_public_key');
const destination = new PublicKey('destination_public_key');
const authority = new PublicKey('authority_public_key');
const amount = 1000;
const decimals = 9;

const transactionSignature = await mintToChecked(
    connection,
    payer,
    mint,
    destination,
    authority,
    amount,
    decimals
);
console.log('Transaction Signature:', transactionSignature);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to mint tokens to a specified account using the `mintToChecked` function, providing the necessary parameters such as connection, payer, mint, destination, authority, amount, and decimals.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `mintToChecked` function?
   **Answer:** The `mintToChecked` function is used to mint tokens to an account while asserting the token mint and decimals. It takes various parameters like connection, payer, mint, destination, authority, amount, decimals, multiSigners, confirmOptions, and programId, and returns the signature of the confirmed transaction.

2. **Question:** How does the `mintToChecked` function handle multisig authorities?
   **Answer:** The `mintToChecked` function handles multisig authorities by accepting an optional `multiSigners` parameter, which is an array of Signer objects. The `getSigners` function is then used to extract the authority public key and signers from the provided authority and multiSigners.

3. **Question:** What is the role of the `createMintToCheckedInstruction` function in the `mintToChecked` function?
   **Answer:** The `createMintToCheckedInstruction` function is used to create a MintToChecked instruction, which is then added to the transaction. This instruction contains the necessary information for minting tokens, such as mint, destination, authority public key, amount, decimals, multiSigners, and programId.
