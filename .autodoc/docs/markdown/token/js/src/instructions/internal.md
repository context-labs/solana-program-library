The code provided is a utility function called `addSigners` that is part of the Solana Program Library. This function is used to add signers to an array of `AccountMeta` objects, which represent the metadata of Solana accounts involved in a transaction. The purpose of this function is to simplify the process of adding signers to a transaction, especially when dealing with multisignature accounts.

The `addSigners` function takes three arguments:

1. `keys`: An array of `AccountMeta` objects that will be updated with the new signers.
2. `ownerOrAuthority`: A `PublicKey` representing the owner or authority of the account(s) being updated.
3. `multiSigners`: An array of `Signer` or `PublicKey` objects representing the multiple signers required for a multisignature account.

The function first checks if the `multiSigners` array is not empty, indicating that the account requires multiple signers. If this is the case, it adds the `ownerOrAuthority` as a non-signer and non-writable account to the `keys` array. Then, it iterates through the `multiSigners` array and adds each signer to the `keys` array with the `isSigner` property set to `true` and the `isWritable` property set to `false`.

If the `multiSigners` array is empty, it means that the account does not require multiple signers. In this case, the function adds the `ownerOrAuthority` as a signer and non-writable account to the `keys` array.

Finally, the updated `keys` array is returned.

Here's an example of how this function might be used:

```javascript
import { addSigners } from './addSigners';
import { AccountMeta, PublicKey, Signer } from '@solana/web3.js';

const keys: AccountMeta[] = [];
const ownerOrAuthority = new PublicKey('somePublicKey');
const multiSigners: (Signer | PublicKey)[] = [new PublicKey('signer1'), new PublicKey('signer2')];

const updatedKeys = addSigners(keys, ownerOrAuthority, multiSigners);
```

In this example, the `updatedKeys` array will contain the `ownerOrAuthority` as a non-signer, non-writable account, and the two signers from the `multiSigners` array as signers and non-writable accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `addSigners` function?**

   The `addSigners` function is used to add signers to an array of `AccountMeta` objects, either as a single owner or authority or as multiple signers, depending on the length of the `multiSigners` array.

2. **What are the input parameters for the `addSigners` function?**

   The `addSigners` function takes three input parameters: `keys`, an array of `AccountMeta` objects; `ownerOrAuthority`, a `PublicKey` object representing the owner or authority of the account; and `multiSigners`, an array of `Signer` or `PublicKey` objects representing multiple signers.

3. **How does the function handle the case when there are multiple signers?**

   If the `multiSigners` array has a length greater than zero, the function adds the `ownerOrAuthority` as a non-signer and non-writable account, and then iterates through the `multiSigners` array, adding each signer with the `isSigner` property set to `true` and the `isWritable` property set to `false`. If there are no multiple signers, the `ownerOrAuthority` is added as a signer with the same properties.
