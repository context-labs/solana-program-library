This code demonstrates the process of creating and managing a custom token on the Solana blockchain using the `solana-program-library`. The code imports necessary functions and constants from the `@solana/web3.js` and the custom token library.

First, it establishes a connection to the Solana devnet and generates a keypair for the payer. It then requests an airdrop of 2 SOL to the payer's public key and confirms the transaction.

Next, it generates a keypair for the mint authority and sets the token's decimals. It creates a new mint using the `createMint` function, which takes the connection, payer, mint authority public key, and other parameters.

The code then calculates the required account length and minimum balance for rent exemption using the `getAccountLen` function and `connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption`. It generates keypairs for the owner and destination accounts and creates a new transaction to:

1. Create a new account with the required space and lamports using `SystemProgram.createAccount`.
2. Initialize the account with the mint, owner's public key, and the custom token program ID using `createInitializeAccountInstruction`.
3. Enable required memo transfers for the destination account using `createEnableRequiredMemoTransfersInstruction`.

The transaction is then sent and confirmed using `sendAndConfirmTransaction`.

Finally, the code demonstrates how to disable and enable required memo transfers for the destination account using the `disableRequiredMemoTransfers` and `enableRequiredMemoTransfers` functions, respectively.

This example showcases how to create and manage custom tokens on the Solana blockchain using the `solana-program-library`. The created tokens can be used in various applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant?
   **Answer**: The `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant is used to specify the program ID for the token operations in the Solana Program Library. It is used in various functions like `createMint`, `createInitializeAccountInstruction`, and `createEnableRequiredMemoTransfersInstruction` to associate the token operations with the correct program.

2. **Question**: How does the `createMint` function work and what are its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `createMint` function is used to create a new mint on the Solana blockchain. It takes the following parameters: `connection`, `payer`, `mintAuthority`, `freezeAuthority`, `decimals`, `extensions`, `instructions`, and `programId`. The function creates a new mint with the specified parameters and returns the mint's public key.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `disableRequiredMemoTransfers` and `enableRequiredMemoTransfers` functions?
   **Answer**: The `disableRequiredMemoTransfers` and `enableRequiredMemoTransfers` functions are used to toggle the requirement of memo transfers for a specific token account. Disabling memo transfers means that transfers to the account will not require a memo, while enabling memo transfers means that a memo will be required for transfers to the account.
