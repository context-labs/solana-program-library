This code demonstrates how to create and initialize a non-transferable mint on the Solana blockchain using the `solana-program-library`. The mint is a token with a fixed supply, and non-transferable means that the token cannot be transferred between accounts once it is created. This can be useful for creating tokens that represent unique assets or access rights within a project.

The code starts by importing necessary modules from the `@solana/web3.js` package and the `solana-program-library` project. It then establishes a connection to the Solana devnet using the `Connection` class.

Next, a new keypair is generated for the payer account, and an airdrop request is made to fund the account with 2 SOL. The transaction is confirmed by the network.

A new keypair is generated for the mint authority, which will have control over the mint. The number of decimals for the mint is set to 9.

Another keypair is generated for the mint account, and the required space for the mint account is calculated using the `getMintLen` function. The minimum balance required for rent exemption is then fetched using the `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` method.

A new transaction is created, which includes three instructions:

1. `SystemProgram.createAccount`: This instruction creates a new account for the mint with the required space and lamports, and associates it with the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID`.
2. `createInitializeNonTransferableMintInstruction`: This instruction initializes the mint as non-transferable.
3. `createInitializeMintInstruction`: This instruction initializes the mint with the specified decimals and mint authority.

Finally, the transaction is sent and confirmed using the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function.

This code snippet can be used as a starting point for developers looking to create non-transferable mints on the Solana blockchain using the `solana-program-library`.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `createInitializeNonTransferableMintInstruction` function and how does it differ from the `createInitializeMintInstruction` function?
   
   **Answer:** The `createInitializeNonTransferableMintInstruction` function is used to create an instruction for initializing a non-transferable mint, while the `createInitializeMintInstruction` function is used to create an instruction for initializing a regular mint with transferable tokens. The difference between the two is the transferability of the tokens created by the mint.

2. **Question:** What is the significance of the `ExtensionType.NonTransferable` parameter in the `getMintLen` function?

   **Answer:** The `ExtensionType.NonTransferable` parameter is used to specify that the mint length should be calculated for a non-transferable mint. This is important because non-transferable mints have different requirements and constraints compared to regular mints, and the length calculation needs to account for these differences.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant and how is it used in the code?

   **Answer:** The `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant represents the program ID of the token program that will be used to create and manage the mint and its associated tokens. It is used in the `SystemProgram.createAccount` and `createInitializeMintInstruction` functions to associate the mint account with the correct token program.
