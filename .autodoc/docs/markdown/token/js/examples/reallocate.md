This code demonstrates how to create and configure a custom token on the Solana blockchain using the solana-program-library. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Establishes a connection to the Solana devnet.
2. Generates a new keypair for the payer and requests an airdrop of 2 SOL to fund the payer's account.
3. Creates a new mint for the custom token with a specified number of decimals and a mint authority.
4. Generates a new keypair for the token owner and creates an associated token account.
5. Enables the MemoTransfer extension for the token and configures the token to require memo transfers.

Here's a brief explanation of the key functions used in the code:

- `createMint`: Creates a new mint for the custom token. It takes parameters such as the connection, payer, mint authority, freeze authority, decimals, and the program ID for the token.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  const mint = await createMint(
      connection,
      payer,
      mintAuthority.publicKey,
      mintAuthority.publicKey,
      decimals,
      undefined,
      undefined,
      TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID
  );
  ```

- `createAccount`: Creates a new token account for the specified owner. It takes parameters such as the connection, payer, mint, owner's public key, and the program ID for the token.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  const account = await createAccount(
      connection,
      payer,
      mint,
      owner.publicKey,
      undefined,
      undefined,
      TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID
  );
  ```

- `createReallocateInstruction`: Creates a reallocate instruction for the token account. It takes parameters such as the account, source authority, extensions, destination authority, and the program ID for the token.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  createReallocateInstruction(
      account,
      payer.publicKey,
      extensions,
      owner.publicKey,
      undefined,
      TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID
  )
  ```

- `createEnableRequiredMemoTransfersInstruction`: Creates an instruction to enable required memo transfers for the token account. It takes parameters such as the account, authority, signers, and the program ID for the token.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  createEnableRequiredMemoTransfersInstruction(account, owner.publicKey, [], TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID)
  ```

The script concludes by sending and confirming the transaction, which includes both the reallocate instruction and the enable required memo transfers instruction.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant and where is it defined?
   **Answer:** `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` is a constant representing the program ID for the token program being used in this script. It is imported from the '../src' module.

2. **Question:** What does the `createReallocateInstruction` function do and what are its parameters?
   **Answer:** `createReallocateInstruction` is a function that creates a reallocate instruction for the token account. Its parameters are the token account, the source account, the extensions, the owner's public key, an optional authority, and the token program ID.

3. **Question:** How does the `createEnableRequiredMemoTransfersInstruction` function work and what are its parameters?
   **Answer:** `createEnableRequiredMemoTransfersInstruction` is a function that creates an instruction to enable required memo transfers for a token account. Its parameters are the token account, the owner's public key, an array of extensions, and the token program ID.
