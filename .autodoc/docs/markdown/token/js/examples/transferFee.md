This code demonstrates the usage of the Solana Program Library (SPL) to create and manage a custom token with transfer fees on the Solana blockchain. The code imports necessary functions and constants from the `@solana/web3.js` and the SPL.

The main function is an asynchronous self-invoking function that performs the following tasks:

1. **Initialize variables**: Generate keypairs for the payer, mint authority, transfer fee config authority, and withdraw withheld authority. Set the token's decimals, fee basis points, and maximum fee.

2. **Create a connection**: Connect to the Solana devnet and request an airdrop of 2 SOL to the payer's account.

3. **Create and initialize the mint**: Create a new account for the mint with the required lamports and space. Initialize the mint with the transfer fee config and mint authority.

4. **Mint tokens**: Create a source account for the token and mint an initial amount of tokens to it.

5. **Transfer tokens with fee**: Create a destination account and transfer tokens from the source account to the destination account, applying the transfer fee.

6. **Get all accounts**: Retrieve all accounts associated with the custom token.

7. **Withdraw withheld tokens**: Iterate through the accounts, and if they have withheld tokens, withdraw them to the destination account.

8. **Harvest withheld tokens**: Harvest withheld tokens from the destination account to the mint.

9. **Withdraw withheld tokens from mint**: Withdraw withheld tokens from the mint to the destination account.

This code serves as an example of how to create a custom token with transfer fees on the Solana blockchain using the SPL. It demonstrates the process of initializing the mint, minting tokens, transferring tokens with fees, and managing withheld tokens.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant in this code?
   **Answer:** `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` is a constant representing the program ID of the token being used in this code. It is used in various functions to identify the specific token program that the code interacts with.

2. **Question:** How is the transfer fee calculated in this code?
   **Answer:** The transfer fee is calculated using the `feeBasisPoints` variable, which represents the fee rate in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%). The fee is calculated as `(transferAmount * BigInt(feeBasisPoints)) / BigInt(10_000)`.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `withdrawWithheldTokensFromAccounts` function in this code?
   **Answer:** The `withdrawWithheldTokensFromAccounts` function is used to withdraw the withheld tokens (transfer fees) from a list of accounts and transfer them to a specified destination account. This is done by providing the necessary authorities, mint, and destination account information.
