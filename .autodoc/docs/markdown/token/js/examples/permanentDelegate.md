This code demonstrates how to create and interact with a custom token on the Solana blockchain using the `solana-program-library`. The code imports necessary functions and classes from the `@solana/web3.js` and the `solana-program-library` itself.

First, it generates keypairs for the payer, mint authority, mint, and permanent delegate. The `extensions` array is created with the `ExtensionType.PermanentDelegate` to enable the permanent delegate feature for the mint. The `mintLen` is calculated based on the extensions, and the `decimals` variable is set to 9.

A connection to the Solana devnet is established, and the payer is airdropped 2 SOL to fund the transactions. The code then calculates the minimum balance required for rent exemption (`mintLamports`) and creates a transaction to initialize the mint and the permanent delegate. The transaction is sent and confirmed on the network.

Next, the code mints an initial amount of tokens (1,000,000,000) to a source account owned by a newly generated owner keypair. The `createAccount` and `mintTo` functions are used to create the source account and mint the tokens, respectively.

A destination account is created with the same mint and owner as the source account. The `transferChecked` function is then used to transfer the minted tokens from the source account to the destination account, signing the transaction with the permanent delegate keypair.

This code example demonstrates how to create a custom token with a permanent delegate feature, mint tokens, and transfer them between accounts on the Solana blockchain using the `solana-program-library`.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant and where is it defined?
   **Answer**: `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` is a constant representing the program ID of the token minting and management program. It is imported from the '../src' module.

2. **Question**: How does the `createInitializePermanentDelegateInstruction` function work and what are its parameters?
   **Answer**: `createInitializePermanentDelegateInstruction` is a function that creates an instruction to initialize a permanent delegate for a mint. It takes three parameters: the mint public key, the permanent delegate public key, and the token program ID.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `transferChecked` function and what are its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `transferChecked` function is used to transfer tokens between accounts with additional checks, such as verifying the mint and decimals. It takes several parameters: the connection, payer, source account, mint, destination account, permanent delegate, transfer amount, decimals, optional signers, optional commitment, and the token program ID.
