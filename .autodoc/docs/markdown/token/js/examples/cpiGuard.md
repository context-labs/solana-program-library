This code demonstrates the usage of the Solana Program Library (SPL) to create and manage a custom token on the Solana blockchain. The code imports necessary functions and constants from the `@solana/web3.js` and the custom token implementation in the `../src` directory.

The code starts by establishing a connection to the Solana devnet and generating a keypair for the payer. It then requests an airdrop of 2 SOL to the payer's public key and confirms the transaction.

Next, it generates a keypair for the mint authority and creates a new custom token mint with 9 decimals, using the `createMint` function. The mint is associated with the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID`, which is a custom token program ID.

The code then calculates the required account length and minimum balance for rent exemption using the `getAccountLen` function and `connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` method. It generates keypairs for the owner and destination accounts and creates a new transaction to:

1. Create a new account for the destination with the required space and lamports.
2. Initialize the destination account with the mint, owner's public key, and the custom token program ID.
3. Enable the CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) guard for the destination account.

The transaction is then sent and confirmed using the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function.

Finally, the code demonstrates disabling and enabling the CPI guard for the destination account using the `disableCpiGuard` and `enableCpiGuard` functions, respectively.

This code snippet is a useful example for developers looking to create and manage custom tokens on the Solana blockchain using the SPL. It showcases the process of creating a mint, initializing accounts, and managing CPI guards for token accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` constant and where is it defined?

   **Answer:** `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` is a constant representing the program ID of the token being used in this script. It is imported from the '../src' module, which means it is defined in the source files of the solana-program-library project.

2. **Question:** What is the role of the `ExtensionType.CpiGuard` in the `getAccountLen()` function?

   **Answer:** `ExtensionType.CpiGuard` is an enumeration value representing a specific type of account extension. It is passed as an argument to the `getAccountLen()` function, which calculates the length of the account based on the provided extension type.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `disableCpiGuard` and `enableCpiGuard` functions, and when are they used in this code?

   **Answer:** `disableCpiGuard` and `enableCpiGuard` are functions that disable and enable the CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) guard, respectively. They are used in this code to demonstrate how to toggle the CPI guard for a specific account. Disabling the CPI guard allows other programs to interact with the account, while enabling it prevents unauthorized access.
