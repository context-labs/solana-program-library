This code defines the `InterestBearingMintInstruction` enum and related functions for the Solana Program Library's interest-bearing mint extension. The extension allows creating and managing mints with interest accrual capabilities.

The `InterestBearingMintInstruction` enum has two variants:

1. `Initialize`: Initializes a new mint with interest accrual. This must be called before the `InitializeMint` instruction. The mint should have enough space allocated for the base mint, padding, account type, and extension data. The expected accounts and data for this instruction are the mint to initialize and the `InitializeInstructionData` struct.

```rust
pub struct InitializeInstructionData {
    pub rate_authority: OptionalNonZeroPubkey,
    pub rate: BasisPoints,
}
```

2. `UpdateRate`: Updates the interest rate for a mint that includes the `InterestBearingConfig` extension. This instruction supports both single authority and multisignature authority. The expected accounts and data for this instruction are the mint, rate authority, signer accounts (if multisignature), and the new interest rate as `BasisPoints`.

The code also provides two functions to create the corresponding instructions:

1. `initialize(token_program_id: &Pubkey, mint: &Pubkey, rate_authority: Option<Pubkey>, rate: i16) -> Result<Instruction, ProgramError>`: Creates an `Initialize` instruction with the given parameters.

2. `update_rate(token_program_id: &Pubkey, mint: &Pubkey, rate_authority: &Pubkey, signers: &[&Pubkey], rate: i16) -> Result<Instruction, ProgramError>`: Creates an `UpdateRate` instruction with the given parameters.

These functions and the `InterestBearingMintInstruction` enum are used in the larger project to manage interest-bearing mints and their interest rates.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `InterestBearingMintInstruction` enum?
   **Answer**: The `InterestBearingMintInstruction` enum defines the different instructions that can be used with the interest-bearing mint extension, such as initializing a new mint with interest accrual (`Initialize`) and updating the interest rate (`UpdateRate`).

2. **Question**: How is the `InitializeInstructionData` struct used in the `initialize` function?
   **Answer**: The `InitializeInstructionData` struct is used to store the rate authority and initial interest rate for the mint. It is then passed as data to the `encode_instruction` function when creating the `Initialize` instruction.

3. **Question**: How does the `update_rate` function handle multisignature authorities?
   **Answer**: The `update_rate` function takes an array of signer public keys (`signers`) as input. If the `signers` array is not empty, it assumes a multisignature authority is being used and adds the signer accounts as read-only and signer-required `AccountMeta` to the instruction's accounts.
