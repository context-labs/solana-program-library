The code defines a module for the CPI Guard extension in the Solana Program Library. The CPI Guard extension provides a mechanism to restrict certain token operations from taking place within Cross-Program Invocations (CPI) for a specific account. This can be useful for enhancing the security of token accounts by limiting the actions that can be performed via CPI.

The `CpiGuardInstruction` enum defines two instructions: `Enable` and `Disable`. The `Enable` instruction locks certain token operations for the specified account, such as Transfer, Burn, CloseAccount, SetAuthority, and Approve. These operations must go through a delegate, can only return lamports to the owner, can only be used to remove an existing close authority, or are disallowed entirely. The `Disable` instruction allows all token operations to happen via CPI as normal.

The module provides two public functions, `enable_cpi_guard` and `disable_cpi_guard`, which create the `Enable` and `Disable` instructions, respectively. Both functions take the token program ID, the account to update, the account's owner, and an array of signer accounts as input. They return a `Result<Instruction, ProgramError>`.

Here's an example of how to create an `Enable` instruction:

```rust
let token_program_id = ...;
let account = ...;
let owner = ...;
let signers = [...];
let enable_instruction = enable_cpi_guard(&token_program_id, &account, &owner, &signers)?;
```

And here's an example of how to create a `Disable` instruction:

```rust
let token_program_id = ...;
let account = ...;
let owner = ...;
let signers = [...];
let disable_instruction = disable_cpi_guard(&token_program_id, &account, &owner, &signers)?;
```

These instructions can be included in a transaction to enable or disable the CPI Guard for a specific account.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `CpiGuardInstruction` enum?**

   The `CpiGuardInstruction` enum represents the two possible instructions for the CPI Guard extension: `Enable` and `Disable`. These instructions are used to lock or unlock certain token operations within the Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) for a specific account.

2. **How does the `enable_cpi_guard` function work?**

   The `enable_cpi_guard` function creates an `Enable` instruction for the CPI Guard extension. It takes the token program ID, the account to update, the account's owner, and an array of signer accounts as input. It then constructs an `Instruction` object with the necessary account metadata and the `Enable` variant of the `CpiGuardInstruction` enum.

3. **What is the difference between the `enable_cpi_guard` and `disable_cpi_guard` functions?**

   Both functions create an instruction for the CPI Guard extension, but the `enable_cpi_guard` function creates an `Enable` instruction to lock certain token operations within CPI, while the `disable_cpi_guard` function creates a `Disable` instruction to allow all token operations to happen via CPI as normal.
