The code provided is a part of the Solana Program Library and defines an `ImmutableOwner` extension. This extension is used to indicate that the owner authority of an account cannot be changed. This can be useful in scenarios where an account's ownership should remain constant, ensuring that the account's assets or permissions are not transferred to another party.

The `ImmutableOwner` struct is defined with the following attributes:

- `#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Default, PartialEq, Pod, Zeroable)]`: This line uses the `derive` attribute to automatically implement common traits for the `ImmutableOwner` struct. These traits include `Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `Default`, `PartialEq`, `Pod` (Plain Old Data), and `Zeroable`.
- `#[repr(transparent)]`: This attribute ensures that the `ImmutableOwner` struct has the same memory layout as its single field. This is useful for FFI (Foreign Function Interface) and for safe casting between types.

The `ImmutableOwner` struct implements the `Extension` trait, which is a part of the Solana Program Library's extension system. The extension system allows for custom functionality to be added to accounts in a modular and composable way. By implementing the `Extension` trait, the `ImmutableOwner` struct gains the ability to be used as an extension in the larger project.

The `Extension` trait implementation for `ImmutableOwner` includes the following associated constant:

- `const TYPE: ExtensionType = ExtensionType::ImmutableOwner;`: This line defines the `TYPE` constant for the `ImmutableOwner` extension, which is set to the `ImmutableOwner` variant of the `ExtensionType` enum. This allows the extension system to identify and work with the `ImmutableOwner` extension.

In summary, this code defines an `ImmutableOwner` extension for the Solana Program Library, which indicates that the owner authority of an account cannot be changed. By implementing the `Extension` trait, the `ImmutableOwner` struct can be used as a part of the larger extension system in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ImmutableOwner` struct?
   **Answer:** The `ImmutableOwner` struct is used to indicate that the Account owner authority cannot be changed in the solana-program-library.

2. **Question:** How does the `ImmutableOwner` struct implement the `Extension` trait?
   **Answer:** The `ImmutableOwner` struct implements the `Extension` trait by providing a constant `TYPE` with the value `ExtensionType::ImmutableOwner`.

3. **Question:** What are the derived traits for the `ImmutableOwner` struct and why are they used?
   **Answer:** The derived traits for the `ImmutableOwner` struct are `Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `Default`, `PartialEq`, `Pod`, and `Zeroable`. These traits provide common functionality like cloning, copying, debugging, default value creation, equality comparison, and memory layout compatibility for the `ImmutableOwner` struct.
