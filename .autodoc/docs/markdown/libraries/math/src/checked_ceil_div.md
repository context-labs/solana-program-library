The code defines a trait `CheckedCeilDiv` that performs checked ceiling division for different types, specifically `u128` and `U256`. The purpose of this trait is to provide a more accurate division calculation that avoids truncating values more than necessary.

The `CheckedCeilDiv` trait has a single method, `checked_ceil_div`, which takes a reference to `self` and another value of the same type, `rhs`. It returns an `Option<(Self, Self)>`, which is a tuple containing the quotient and divisor if the calculation is successful, or `None` if it fails.

The implementation of `checked_ceil_div` for both `u128` and `U256` follows the same logic. First, it calculates the quotient using `checked_div`. If the quotient is zero, it returns `None` to avoid dividing a small number by a large one and returning 1. Next, it checks for a remainder using `checked_rem`. If there is a remainder, it increments the quotient by 1 and recalculates the divisor to minimize truncation. Finally, it returns the tuple containing the updated quotient and divisor.

Here's an example of how this trait might be used:

```rust
use solana_program_library::CheckedCeilDiv;

fn main() {
    let dividend = 400u128;
    let divisor = 32u128;
    let result = dividend.checked_ceil_div(divisor);
    match result {
        Some((quotient, new_divisor)) => {
            println!("Quotient: {}, New Divisor: {}", quotient, new_divisor);
        }
        None => {
            println!("Calculation failed");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `checked_ceil_div` method is called on a `u128` dividend with a divisor of 32. The output will be "Quotient: 13, New Divisor: 31", which is a more accurate calculation than simply rounding up the quotient.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `CheckedCeilDiv` trait and its `checked_ceil_div` function?
   **Answer:** The `CheckedCeilDiv` trait defines a method for performing checked ceiling division for different types. The `checked_ceil_div` function performs a division that does not truncate value from either side and returns the (quotient, divisor) as a tuple, providing a more fair calculation without cutting off more value than needed.

2. **Question:** How does the implementation of `CheckedCeilDiv` differ for `u128` and `U256` types?
   **Answer:** The implementation of `CheckedCeilDiv` for `u128` and `U256` types is mostly similar, with the main difference being the use of `U256::from(0)` and `U256::from(1)` for the `zero` and `one` constants in the `U256` implementation, while the `u128` implementation uses the literals `0` and `1` directly.

3. **Question:** What is the reason for checking if the quotient is zero and returning `None` in the `checked_ceil_div` function?
   **Answer:** The check for quotient being zero is done to avoid dividing a small number by a big one and returning 1, which would not be a fair calculation. Instead, the function returns `None` to indicate that the calculation fails in such cases.
