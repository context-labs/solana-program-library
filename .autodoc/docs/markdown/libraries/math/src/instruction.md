This code defines a set of mathematical instructions for the Solana Program Library, which can be used for end-to-end testing and instruction counts. The `MathInstruction` enum lists the supported instructions, including operations like square root, multiplication, division, exponentiation, natural logarithm, and normal cumulative distribution function (CDF). These instructions work with different data types such as u64, u128, and f32.

The code also provides functions to create instances of the `Instruction` struct for each mathematical operation. These functions take the required input parameters for the operation and return an `Instruction` with the appropriate program ID, an empty accounts vector, and serialized data containing the specific `MathInstruction` variant with the input parameters.

For example, to create an instruction for calculating the square root of a u64 value, you can use the `sqrt_u64(radicand: u64)` function:

```rust
let instruction = sqrt_u64(64);
```

This will create an `Instruction` with the program ID set to the Solana Program Library's ID, no accounts, and the serialized data containing the `SquareRootU64` variant with the radicand set to 64.

The code also includes unit tests for each instruction creation function, ensuring that the generated instructions have the correct program ID, no accounts, and the expected serialized data.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `MathInstruction` enum?**

   The `MathInstruction` enum defines the various mathematical operations supported by the math program, such as square root, multiplication, division, exponentiation, natural log, and normal CDF. These instructions are used for end-to-end testing and instruction counts.

2. **How are the instructions created for each mathematical operation?**

   There are separate functions for creating instructions for each mathematical operation, such as `precise_sqrt`, `sqrt_u64`, `u64_multiply`, `f32_divide`, etc. These functions take the required input parameters and return an `Instruction` struct with the appropriate program ID, accounts, and serialized data.

3. **What is the purpose of the `Noop` variant in the `MathInstruction` enum?**

   The `Noop` variant is used for creating an instruction that does nothing, which can be useful for comparison purposes or as a placeholder when no operation is needed. It requires no accounts and has no associated data.
