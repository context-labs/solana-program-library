The `ConcurrentMerkleTree` is a Merkle Tree implementation that allows multiple tree operations targeted for the same tree root to succeed. It is designed to handle concurrent operations efficiently by storing a buffer of modified nodes (`change_logs`) and implementing fast-forwarding of concurrent Merkle tree operations.

The main operations supported by `ConcurrentMerkleTree` are `set_leaf` and `append`. The `set_leaf` operation updates the leaf at a given index, while the `append` operation adds a new leaf to the tree. The `append` operation does not require any proofs to be passed, as it keeps track of the proof to the rightmost leaf in the tree (`rightmost_proof`).

The `ConcurrentMerkleTree` also provides methods for initializing the tree, checking if a leaf exists in the current tree root, and verifying the validity of a proof. The `prove_leaf` method attempts to prove the leaf first using the provided proof nodes, and if this fails, constructs a proof by inferring it from the changelog buffer.

Here's an example of how to use the `ConcurrentMerkleTree`:

```rust
let mut tree = ConcurrentMerkleTree::<MAX_DEPTH, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE>::new();
tree.initialize()?;
tree.append(leaf)?;
let new_root = tree.set_leaf(current_root, previous_leaf, new_leaf, &proof_vec, index)?;
```

The `ConcurrentMerkleTree` is useful in the larger project for efficiently handling concurrent updates to the Merkle tree, which is a common requirement in distributed systems and blockchain applications.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `ConcurrentMerkleTree` struct and how does it work?**

   The `ConcurrentMerkleTree` struct represents a Merkle Tree that allows multiple tree operations targeted for the same tree root to succeed. It stores a buffer of modified nodes (`change_logs`) which enables fast-forwarding of concurrent Merkle tree operations. As long as the concurrent operations have proofs that are valid for a previous state of the tree found in the stored buffer, the tree operation's proof can be fast-forwarded and the operation can be applied.

2. **What are the two primitive operations for `ConcurrentMerkleTree`?**

   The two primitive operations for `ConcurrentMerkleTree` are `set_leaf` and `append`. Setting a leaf value requires passing a proof to perform the tree operation, while appending does not require a proof.

3. **What is the purpose of the `fast_forward_proof` function and how does it work?**

   The `fast_forward_proof` function modifies the proof for a leaf at a given index in place by fast-forwarding the given proof through the changelogs, starting at a specified index. It iterates through the change log and updates the proof accordingly. If the leaf was updated in the change log, it returns false, otherwise, it returns true.
