This code is part of the Solana Program Library and is responsible for handling Account Compression Events. It is generated using the `solita` package, which is a code generation tool for Solana programs. The code should not be edited directly, but rather updated using `solita` or by writing a wrapper to add functionality.

The main purpose of this code is to define the `AccountCompressionEvent` type, which is a union type representing the data enum defined in Rust. It is derived from the `AccountCompressionEventRecord` type, which contains two fields: `ChangeLog` and `ApplicationData`. Each field is associated with a specific event type: `ChangeLogEvent` and `ApplicationDataEvent`.

The `AccountCompressionEvent` type includes a `__kind` property, which allows narrowing types in switch/if statements. Additionally, two type guards are provided: `isAccountCompressionEventChangeLog` and `isAccountCompressionEventApplicationData`. These type guards can be used to narrow down the specific variant of the `AccountCompressionEvent`.

The `accountCompressionEventBeet` constant is an instance of `beet.FixableBeet<AccountCompressionEvent>`, which is used for de/serialization of the `AccountCompressionEvent` type. It is created using the `beet.dataEnum` function, which takes an array of tuples containing the variant name and a `beet.FixableBeetArgsStruct` instance for each variant.

Here's an example of how to use the `AccountCompressionEvent` type and the type guards:

```javascript
import {
  AccountCompressionEvent,
  isAccountCompressionEventChangeLog,
  isAccountCompressionEventApplicationData,
} from './AccountCompressionEvent';

function handleAccountCompressionEvent(event: AccountCompressionEvent) {
  if (isAccountCompressionEventChangeLog(event)) {
    // Handle ChangeLog event
  } else if (isAccountCompressionEventApplicationData(event)) {
    // Handle ApplicationData event
  }
}
```

In summary, this code provides a way to handle Account Compression Events in the Solana Program Library, allowing developers to work with different event types and perform type narrowing using the provided type guards.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `AccountCompressionEventRecord` type?**

   The `AccountCompressionEventRecord` type is used to derive the `AccountCompressionEvent` type as well as the de/serializer. It is marked as private and should not be referred to directly in the code.

2. **What is the `AccountCompressionEvent` type and how is it generated?**

   The `AccountCompressionEvent` type is a union type representing the AccountCompressionEvent data enum defined in Rust. It is generated using the `beet.DataEnumKeyAsKind<AccountCompressionEventRecord>` function.

3. **What are the `isAccountCompressionEventChangeLog` and `isAccountCompressionEventApplicationData` functions used for?**

   These functions are type guards that help to narrow down the type of an `AccountCompressionEvent` object to a specific variant, either 'ChangeLog' or 'ApplicationData', by checking the `__kind` property of the object.
