This code defines a set of macros that apply functions on a `ConcurrentMerkleTree` and emit leaf information needed to sync the Merkle tree state with off-chain indexers. The `ConcurrentMerkleTree` is a data structure that allows concurrent reads and writes, which is useful for parallel processing in the Solana Program Library.

The `_merkle_tree_depth_size_apply_fn` macro is the core macro that applies a given function `$func` on a `ConcurrentMerkleTree` with specified `$max_depth` and `$max_size`. It supports both mutable and immutable tree loads, as indicated by the `TreeLoad` enum. The macro first loads the Merkle tree from the given `$bytes`, then applies the function and returns a `ChangeLogEvent` containing the tree's change log, `$id`, and sequence number.

The `_merkle_tree_apply_fn` macro is a higher-level macro that infers the size of the tree based on the header information stored on-chain. It matches the `($header.get_max_depth(), $header.get_max_buffer_size())` tuple to the appropriate `_merkle_tree_depth_size_apply_fn` invocation with the correct depth and size literals.

Finally, the `merkle_tree_apply_fn_mut` and `merkle_tree_apply_fn` macros are provided as convenient wrappers for applying functions on mutable and read-only `ConcurrentMerkleTree` instances, respectively. They internally call the `_merkle_tree_apply_fn` macro with the appropriate `TreeLoad` variant.

Here's an example of how to use the `merkle_tree_apply_fn_mut` macro:

```rust
merkle_tree_apply_fn_mut!(header, id, bytes, some_function, arg1, arg2);
```

This will apply `some_function` on a mutable `ConcurrentMerkleTree` with the depth and size inferred from the `header`, passing `arg1` and `arg2` as arguments to the function.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `TreeLoad` enum?**

   The `TreeLoad` enum is used to differentiate between mutable and immutable tree loading operations in the `_merkle_tree_depth_size_apply_fn` macro.

2. **What does the `_merkle_tree_depth_size_apply_fn` macro do?**

   The `_merkle_tree_depth_size_apply_fn` macro is a helper macro that applies a given function on a `ConcurrentMerkleTree` with specified maximum depth and size, and returns a `ChangeLogEvent` containing the tree's change log, ID, and sequence number.

3. **How do the `merkle_tree_apply_fn_mut` and `merkle_tree_apply_fn` macros differ?**

   The `merkle_tree_apply_fn_mut` macro applies a given function on a mutable `ConcurrentMerkleTree`, while the `merkle_tree_apply_fn` macro applies the function on a read-only (immutable) `ConcurrentMerkleTree`. Both macros use the `_merkle_tree_apply_fn` macro internally with the appropriate `TreeLoad` value (Mutable or Immutable).
