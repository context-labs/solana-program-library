This code provides general-purpose utility structs for the Solana Program Library, specifically for reserving byte arrays of fixed sizes. These structs can be used to reserve space in data structures for future expansion or to align data structures in memory.

There are two structs defined in this code: `Reserved110` and `Reserved120`. Both structs have three fields, each representing a reserved byte array of a specific size. The `Reserved110` struct reserves 110 bytes in total, with byte arrays of sizes 64, 32, and 14. The `Reserved120` struct reserves 120 bytes in total, with byte arrays of sizes 64, 32, and 24.

Both structs implement the `Default` trait, which provides a default implementation for initializing the structs with zero-filled byte arrays. This is useful when creating instances of these structs without needing to manually set each field to a zero-filled array.

The structs also derive several traits, such as `Clone`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `BorshDeserialize`, `BorshSerialize`, and `BorshSchema`. These traits enable the structs to be easily cloned, compared, debug-printed, and serialized/deserialized using the Borsh binary serialization format.

Here's an example of how these structs can be used in a larger data structure:

```rust
use solana_program::borsh_utils::Reserved110;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize, BorshSchema)]
pub struct MyData {
    pub field1: u64,
    pub field2: u32,
    pub reserved: Reserved110,
}
```

In this example, the `MyData` struct contains two fields, `field1` and `field2`, and a `Reserved110` field to reserve 110 bytes for future expansion. This ensures that the data structure can be extended later without breaking compatibility with existing serialized data.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Reserved110` and `Reserved120` structs in this code?
   **Answer**: The `Reserved110` and `Reserved120` structs are used to reserve a specific amount of bytes (110 and 120 bytes, respectively) in memory. They can be useful for padding or reserving space for future updates in data structures.

2. **Question**: What is the role of the `BorshDeserialize`, `BorshSerialize`, and `BorshSchema` traits in this code?
   **Answer**: The `BorshDeserialize`, `BorshSerialize`, and `BorshSchema` traits are part of the Borsh library, which provides a way to serialize and deserialize data structures in a binary format. These traits are implemented for the `Reserved110` and `Reserved120` structs, allowing them to be easily serialized and deserialized using the Borsh library.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Default` trait implementation for the `Reserved110` and `Reserved120` structs?
   **Answer**: The `Default` trait implementation for the `Reserved110` and `Reserved120` structs provides a default value for each struct, initializing all the reserved bytes to 0. This allows for easy creation of new instances of these structs with the reserved bytes set to their default values.
