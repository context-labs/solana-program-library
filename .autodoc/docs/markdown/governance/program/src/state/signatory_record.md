The `SignatoryRecordV2` struct represents a signatory record in the Solana Program Library's governance module. It stores information about a signatory who can sign off on a proposal. The struct contains fields such as the account type, proposal, signatory, signed-off status, and reserved space for future versions.

The `SignatoryRecordV2` struct implements the `AccountMaxSize` and `IsInitialized` traits. The `is_initialized` method checks if the account type is `GovernanceAccountType::SignatoryRecordV2`.

The `assert_can_sign_off` method checks if the signatory hasn't signed off yet and is the transaction signer. If the signatory has already signed off or is not the signer, an error is returned.

The `assert_can_remove_signatory` method checks if the signatory can be removed from the proposal. If the signatory has already signed off, an error is returned.

The `serialize` method serializes the account into the target buffer. If the account type is `GovernanceAccountType::SignatoryRecordV1`, it translates the account back to the original format.

The `get_signatory_record_address_seeds` function returns the seeds for the SignatoryRecord PDA (Program Derived Address). The `get_signatory_record_address` function returns the SignatoryRecord PDA address using the seeds.

The `get_signatory_record_data` function deserializes the SignatoryRecord account and checks the owner program. If the account is a V1 version, it translates it to V2.

The `get_signatory_record_data_for_seeds` function deserializes the SignatoryRecord and validates its PDA. If the address does not match the expected PDA, an error is returned.

These functions and methods are used in the larger project to manage signatories and their actions in the governance module, such as signing off on proposals and removing signatories from proposals.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SignatoryRecordV2` struct and how does it differ from `SignatoryRecordV1`?
   **Answer**: The `SignatoryRecordV2` struct represents a signatory record for a proposal in the governance program. It differs from `SignatoryRecordV1` by having an additional field `reserved_v2` which is reserved for future versions and provides backward compatibility.

2. **Question**: How does the `serialize` method work for both `SignatoryRecordV2` and `SignatoryRecordV1`?
   **Answer**: The `serialize` method checks the `account_type` field to determine whether the account is of type `SignatoryRecordV2` or `SignatoryRecordV1`. If it's a V2 account, it serializes the struct directly. If it's a V1 account, it translates the V2 struct back to the V1 format and serializes it, ensuring backward compatibility.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `get_signatory_record_data_for_seeds` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `get_signatory_record_data_for_seeds` function is used to deserialize a `SignatoryRecordV2` account and validate its PDA (Program Derived Address) using the provided seeds (proposal and signatory). It checks if the computed PDA matches the provided account key and then retrieves the signatory record data.
