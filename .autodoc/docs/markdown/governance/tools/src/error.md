The code provided defines a custom error type, `GovernanceToolsError`, for the Solana Program Library's Governance Tools module. This error type is used to handle and report errors that may occur within the module. The `GovernanceToolsError` enum contains several variants, each representing a specific error that may occur during the execution of the Governance Tools module:

1. `AccountAlreadyInitialized`: Indicates that an account has already been initialized.
2. `AccountDoesNotExist`: Indicates that an account does not exist.
3. `InvalidAccountOwner`: Indicates that the account owner is invalid.
4. `InvalidAccountType`: Indicates that the account type is invalid.
5. `InvalidNewAccountSize`: Indicates that the new account size is invalid.

The `GovernanceToolsError` enum derives several traits, such as `Clone`, `Debug`, `Eq`, `Error`, `FromPrimitive`, and `PartialEq`, which provide additional functionality and make it easier to work with the error type.

The `PrintProgramError` trait is implemented for `GovernanceToolsError`, allowing it to be printed as a human-readable string. The `print` method is used to display the error message with a "GOVERNANCE-TOOLS-ERROR" prefix.

The `From` trait is implemented to convert a `GovernanceToolsError` into a `ProgramError`. This allows the custom error type to be used seamlessly with the Solana Program Library's error handling system.

Lastly, the `DecodeError` trait is implemented for `GovernanceToolsError`, providing a method to return a static string describing the error type. This can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.

In the larger project, the `GovernanceToolsError` type can be used to handle errors specific to the Governance Tools module, making it easier to identify and debug issues within the module. For example, when an error occurs, the appropriate `GovernanceToolsError` variant can be returned, providing a clear and concise description of the problem.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `GovernanceToolsError` enum?
   **Answer**: The `GovernanceToolsError` enum defines a set of custom error types that may be returned by the GovernanceTools program. These error types help in identifying specific issues that may occur during the execution of the program.

2. **Question**: How are the error codes assigned to each variant of the `GovernanceToolsError` enum?
   **Answer**: The error codes are assigned explicitly for some variants (e.g., `AccountAlreadyInitialized = 1100`) and implicitly for others (e.g., `AccountDoesNotExist` will have the value 1101). The implicit assignment follows the order of the variants in the enum, incrementing the value by 1 for each subsequent variant.

3. **Question**: How is the `GovernanceToolsError` enum used with the `ProgramError` type?
   **Answer**: The `GovernanceToolsError` enum is converted into a `ProgramError` type using the `From` trait implementation. This allows the custom error types to be used seamlessly with the standard `ProgramError` type, which is commonly used in Solana programs.
