This code is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that defines the styling and appearance of the search functionality within the Solana Program Library project. The purpose of this code is to ensure that the search bar and search icon are displayed and function correctly on various screen sizes, particularly on smaller screens such as mobile devices.

The `.search-icon` class defines the appearance of the search icon, setting its background image, dimensions, and other properties. The `display: none;` property initially hides the search icon.

The `.search-icon-hidden` class is used to hide the search icon by setting its visibility to hidden. This can be applied to the search icon element when it should not be visible.

The `@media (max-width: 360px)` block contains CSS rules that apply only when the screen width is 360 pixels or less. This is a responsive design technique to ensure that the search bar and icon are displayed correctly on smaller screens.

Inside the media query block, the `.search-bar` class sets the search bar's width to 0, effectively hiding it, and removes its background, padding, and transition properties. The `.search-bar-expanded` class is used to expand the search bar to a width of 9rem when needed.

The `.search-icon` class within the media query block sets the search icon to be displayed inline and vertically aligned with the text. This ensures that the search icon is visible and properly positioned on smaller screens.

In summary, this code provides the necessary styling for the search functionality in the Solana Program Library project, ensuring that it is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
