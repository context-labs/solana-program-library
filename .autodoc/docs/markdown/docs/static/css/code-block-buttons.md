This code snippet is a part of the Solana Program Library project and provides the styling for a "Copy" button that appears next to code blocks in the documentation. The purpose of this button is to allow users to easily copy the code examples provided in the documentation to their clipboard, making it more convenient for them to use the code in their own projects.

The code is written in CSS and defines the styling and positioning of the "Copy" button and its components. The `pre` class is used to target the code block elements, and the `position: relative;` property ensures that the button is positioned relative to the code block.

The `pre .btnIcon` class defines the styling for the button itself, including its position, appearance, and hover effects. The `position: absolute;` property positions the button relative to the code block, while the `top: 4px;` property sets the distance from the top of the code block. The `z-index: 2;` property ensures that the button is displayed above other elements on the page.

The `pre .btnIcon:hover` class defines the styling for the button when it is hovered over by the user. The `text-decoration: none;` property removes any text decoration, such as underlining, when the button is hovered over.

The `.btnIcon__body` and `.btnIcon svg` classes define the styling for the button's content, including the icon and label. The `display: flex;` property in the `.btnIcon__body` class ensures that the icon and label are aligned horizontally.

The `.btnIcon__label` class defines the font size for the button's label, while the `.btnClipboard` class sets the position of the button from the right side of the code block.

Overall, this code snippet enhances the user experience by providing a convenient way for users to copy code examples from the Solana Program Library documentation.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `pre` class in this code?
   **Answer**: The `pre` class is used to define the styling for the preformatted text elements, and it sets the position property to relative, which allows the positioning of the child elements (like the copy button) to be relative to the `pre` element.

2. **Question**: How does the `btnIcon` class affect the appearance and behavior of the button?
   **Answer**: The `btnIcon` class sets the button's position, appearance, and hover behavior. It positions the button absolutely within the `pre` element, sets the cursor to a pointer, and defines the button's appearance (border, padding, color, and background-color). It also includes a transition effect for smooth changes when hovering over the button.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `btnClipboard` class?
   **Answer**: The `btnClipboard` class is used to position the copy button within the `pre` element. It sets the button's position from the right edge of the `pre` element to 10 pixels.
