This code is responsible for adding a "Copy" button to code blocks in the Solana Program Library's documentation. When clicked, the button copies the content of the code block to the user's clipboard. This functionality enhances the user experience by allowing users to easily copy and paste code examples from the documentation into their own projects.

The code starts by defining a `button` function that creates a new button element with the specified label, aria-label, icon, and class name. The button's inner HTML is constructed using the provided icon and label.

Next, the `addButtons` function is defined, which takes a code block selector and a button element as arguments. It finds all code blocks matching the selector and appends a clone of the button element to each code block's parent node.

The `copyIcon` variable holds the SVG markup for the copy icon used in the button. The `addButtons` function is then called with the selector ".hljs" (which targets code blocks styled with the Highlight.js library) and a "Copy" button created using the `button` function and the `copyIcon`.

A new instance of the `ClipboardJS` class is created, targeting all elements with the class "btnClipboard". The `target` option is set to return the `code` element within the button's parent node. This ensures that the content of the code block is copied when the button is clicked.

Finally, an event listener is added to the `clipboard` instance for the "success" event. When the event is triggered, the text of the button is temporarily changed to "Copied" to provide visual feedback to the user. After 2 seconds, the button's text is reverted back to "Copy".
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `button` function in this code?
   **Answer:** The `button` function is used to create a new button element with the given label, ariaLabel, icon, and className. It sets the necessary attributes and innerHTML for the button and returns the created button element.

2. **Question:** How does the `addButtons` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer:** The `addButtons` function takes a codeBlockSelector and a button as arguments. It finds all the elements matching the codeBlockSelector and appends a clone of the given button to each of these elements. The purpose of this function is to add the specified button to all the code blocks that match the given selector.

3. **Question:** How is the ClipboardJS library used in this code and what is its purpose?
   **Answer:** The ClipboardJS library is used to create a new clipboard instance with the selector ".btnClipboard" and a target function that returns the code element associated with the trigger (button). The purpose of using ClipboardJS is to enable the copy-to-clipboard functionality for the code blocks when the user clicks the "Copy" button.
