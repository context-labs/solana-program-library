The `ConstantPriceCurve` struct in this code implements the `CurveCalculator` trait, which is used for calculating token swap amounts and pool token conversions in a constant price swap curve. This curve is set at initialization and maintains a fixed price ratio between two tokens (token A and token B) in the swap pool.

The `swap_without_fees` method calculates the amount of tokens to be swapped without considering any fees. It takes the source amount, swap source amount, swap destination amount, and trade direction as input parameters and returns a `SwapWithoutFeesResult` struct containing the source amount swapped and destination amount swapped.

The `pool_tokens_to_trading_tokens` method calculates the amount of trading tokens (token A and token B) for a given amount of pool tokens. It takes the pool tokens, pool token supply, swap token A amount, swap token B amount, and round direction as input parameters and returns a `TradingTokenResult` struct containing the token A amount and token B amount.

The `deposit_single_token_type` and `withdraw_single_token_type_exact_out` methods are used for depositing and withdrawing a single token type (either token A or token B) and return the amount of pool tokens for the given amount of token A or B.

The `validate` and `validate_supply` methods are used to validate the curve and token supply, respectively.

The `normalized_value` method calculates the total normalized value of the constant price curve by adding the total value of the token B side to the token A side and dividing by 2.

Example usage:

```rust
let token_b_price = 1000;
let curve = ConstantPriceCurve { token_b_price };

let source_amount = 5000;
let swap_source_amount = 10000;
let swap_destination_amount = 2000;

let result = curve
    .swap_without_fees(
        source_amount,
        swap_source_amount,
        swap_destination_amount,
        TradeDirection::AtoB,
    )
    .unwrap();

println!("Source amount swapped: {}", result.source_amount_swapped);
println!("Destination amount swapped: {}", result.destination_amount_swapped);
```

In the larger project, this code is used for handling token swaps and pool token conversions in a constant price swap curve within the Solana Program Library.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ConstantPriceCurve` struct and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `ConstantPriceCurve` struct is an implementation of the `CurveCalculator` trait, which represents a simple constant price swap curve set at initialization. It is used to calculate swap amounts, deposit and withdrawal conversions, and validate the curve and supply. The curve maintains a constant price ratio between token A and token B.

2. **Question**: How does the `swap_without_fees` function work and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `swap_without_fees` function calculates the amount of tokens to be swapped without considering any fees. It takes the following inputs: `source_amount` (amount of source tokens to be swapped), `_swap_source_amount` (total amount of source tokens in the swap), `_swap_destination_amount` (total amount of destination tokens in the swap), and `trade_direction` (direction of the trade, either AtoB or BtoA). The function returns an `Option<SwapWithoutFeesResult>` which contains the calculated `source_amount_swapped` and `destination_amount_swapped`.

3. **Question**: How does the `normalized_value` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `normalized_value` function calculates the total normalized value of the constant price curve by adding the total value of the token B side to the token A side. It takes the amounts of token A and token B in the swap as inputs and returns an `Option<PreciseNumber>` representing the normalized value. This function is used to maintain a balanced value between the two token types in the curve.
