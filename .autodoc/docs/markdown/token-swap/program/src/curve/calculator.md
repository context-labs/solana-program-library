This code defines the `CurveCalculator` trait and related structures for the Solana Program Library's swap functionality. The `CurveCalculator` trait represents operations required on a swap curve, which is used to determine token exchange rates in a liquidity pool. The trait includes methods for swapping tokens without fees, calculating pool token amounts for deposits and withdrawals, and validating curve parameters.

The `TradeDirection` enum represents the direction of a trade, either from token A to token B or vice versa. The `RoundDirection` enum is used for rounding values when converting pool tokens to trading tokens.

The `SwapWithoutFeesResult` struct holds the result of a swap operation, including the amount of source and destination tokens swapped. The `TradingTokenResult` struct holds the result of converting pool tokens to trading tokens, containing the amounts of token A and token B.

The code also provides helper functions and test utilities for working with swap curves. The `map_zero_to_none` function maps a zero value to `None`, which is useful for handling calculation failures. The `check_deposit_token_conversion`, `check_withdraw_token_conversion`, and `check_curve_value_from_swap` functions are test utilities that ensure the curve calculations maintain the expected invariants, such as not reducing the overall value of the pool or pool tokens.

Example usage of the `CurveCalculator` trait can be found in the Solana Program Library's swap implementations, where different curve types are defined and used to calculate token exchange rates in liquidity pools.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CurveCalculator` trait and its associated functions?
   **Answer**: The `CurveCalculator` trait represents the operations required on a swap curve. It provides methods for calculating swap amounts, depositing and withdrawing tokens, and validating curve parameters. Implementing this trait allows for different types of swap curves to be used in the Solana program library.

2. **Question**: What is the significance of the `TradeDirection` enum and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `TradeDirection` enum represents the direction of a trade, either from token A to token B (AtoB) or from token B to token A (BtoA). It is used in various functions of the `CurveCalculator` trait to determine the input and output tokens for swap calculations, deposits, and withdrawals.

3. **Question**: How does the `check_pool_value_from_deposit` function in the `test` module ensure that depositing tokens does not reduce the value of pool tokens?
   **Answer**: The `check_pool_value_from_deposit` function checks that the value of pool tokens does not decrease after a deposit by comparing the new token amounts and pool token supply with the previous values. It ensures that the new token amounts, when multiplied by the previous pool token supply, are greater than or equal to the previous token amounts multiplied by the new pool token supply.
