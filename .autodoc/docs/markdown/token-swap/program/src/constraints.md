The code defines a struct `SwapConstraints` and its associated methods to enforce fee constraints and validate curve types in the Solana Program Library's token swap program. This is useful in multihost environments where the program may be used by multiple frontends, ensuring that proper fees are being assessed.

`SwapConstraints` contains the following fields:
- `owner_key`: The owner of the program.
- `valid_curve_types`: An array of valid curve types.
- `fees`: A reference to a `Fees` struct containing valid fees.

Two methods are implemented for `SwapConstraints`:
- `validate_curve(&self, swap_curve: &SwapCurve)`: Checks if the provided `swap_curve` is valid according to the constraints. Returns an error if the curve type is unsupported.
- `validate_fees(&self, fees: &Fees)`: Checks if the provided `fees` are valid according to the constraints. Returns an error if the fees are invalid.

The code also defines constants for production environments, such as `OWNER_KEY`, `FEES`, and `VALID_CURVE_TYPES`. The `SWAP_CONSTRAINTS` constant is set based on whether the "production" feature is enabled or not. If enabled, it is set to an instance of `SwapConstraints` with the production values; otherwise, it is set to `None`.

The test module contains tests for the `validate_fees` method, ensuring that it correctly validates fees and curve types according to the constraints.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SwapConstraints` struct and its associated methods?
   **Answer**: The `SwapConstraints` struct is used to encode fee constraints in multihost environments where the program may be used by multiple frontends. It ensures that proper fees are being assessed. The associated methods `validate_curve` and `validate_fees` are used to check if the provided curve and fees are valid according to the given constraints.

2. **Question**: How does the code handle different build configurations, specifically "production" and "non-production"?
   **Answer**: The code uses conditional compilation with the `#[cfg(feature = "production")]` attribute to define different constants and values for the `SWAP_CONSTRAINTS` depending on whether the "production" feature is enabled or not. In production, the `SwapConstraints` struct is initialized with specific values for `owner_key`, `valid_curve_types`, and `fees`. In non-production, the `SWAP_CONSTRAINTS` is set to `None`.

3. **Question**: How does the `validate_fees` method determine if the provided fees are valid or not?
   **Answer**: The `validate_fees` method checks if the provided fees meet or exceed the minimum required fees specified in the `SwapConstraints` struct. It compares each fee component (trade fee, owner trade fee, owner withdraw fee, and host fee) with the corresponding component in the `SwapConstraints` struct. If all the conditions are met, the method returns `Ok(())`, otherwise, it returns an `Err(SwapError::InvalidFee.into())`.
