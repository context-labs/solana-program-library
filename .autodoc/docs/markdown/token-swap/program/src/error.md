This code defines the error types and their handling for the TokenSwap program in the Solana Program Library. The `SwapError` enum lists all possible errors that can occur during the execution of the TokenSwap program, such as invalid input, incorrect account addresses, calculation failures, and unsupported curve types.

Each error variant in the `SwapError` enum is annotated with a human-readable error message using the `#[error()]` attribute. This makes it easier for developers to understand the cause of an error when it occurs.

The `SwapError` enum implements several traits to facilitate error handling:

- `FromPrimitive`: Allows conversion from primitive integer types to the `SwapError` enum.
- `PrintProgramError`: Provides a method to print the error message associated with each error variant.
- `DecodeError`: Allows decoding of the error from a custom error type.

The `impl From<SwapError> for ProgramError` block provides a conversion from `SwapError` to the more general `ProgramError` type, which is used by the Solana runtime.

The `impl PrintProgramError for SwapError` block defines how to print the error messages for each error variant. This is useful for debugging and logging purposes.

In the larger project, these error types and handling methods help ensure that the TokenSwap program can provide clear and actionable feedback to developers and users when something goes wrong during its execution. For example, if a user tries to swap tokens with an invalid input, the program will return a `SwapError::InvalidInput` error with a helpful message explaining the issue.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SwapError` enum?
   **Answer**: The `SwapError` enum defines various error types that may be returned by the TokenSwap program. Each variant represents a specific error condition that can occur during the execution of the program.

2. **Question**: How are the error messages printed for each `SwapError` variant?
   **Answer**: The `PrintProgramError` trait is implemented for `SwapError`, which provides a `print` method for each variant. This method uses the `msg!` macro to print the error message associated with each error variant.

3. **Question**: How is the `SwapError` enum converted to a `ProgramError`?
   **Answer**: The `From` trait is implemented for converting a `SwapError` into a `ProgramError`. The `from` method takes a `SwapError` instance and returns a `ProgramError::Custom` variant with the error code as a `u32`.
