This code defines the instruction types and related functions for the Solana Program Library's token swap program. The token swap program allows users to swap, deposit, and withdraw tokens in an automated market maker (AMM) pool. The AMM pool maintains a liquidity pool of two tokens and facilitates token swaps based on a specified curve.

The `SwapInstruction` enum represents the different instructions supported by the token swap program, including:

- `Initialize`: Initializes a new swap with specified fees and swap curve.
- `Swap`: Swaps tokens in the pool, with a specified input amount and minimum output amount.
- `DepositAllTokenTypes`: Deposits both types of tokens into the pool, receiving pool tokens in return.
- `WithdrawAllTokenTypes`: Withdraws both types of tokens from the pool, burning pool tokens in exchange.
- `DepositSingleTokenTypeExactAmountIn`: Deposits a single token type into the pool, receiving pool tokens in return.
- `WithdrawSingleTokenTypeExactAmountOut`: Withdraws a single token type from the pool, specifying the exact output amount.

The code also provides functions to pack and unpack these instructions, as well as helper functions to create specific instructions, such as `initialize`, `swap`, `deposit_all_token_types`, `withdraw_all_token_types`, `deposit_single_token_type_exact_amount_in`, and `withdraw_single_token_type_exact_amount_out`.

These instructions can be used in the larger project to interact with the token swap program, enabling users to perform token swaps, deposits, and withdrawals in an AMM pool.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `SwapInstruction` enum?**

   The `SwapInstruction` enum represents the different types of instructions supported by the token swap program. It includes instructions for initializing a new swap, swapping tokens in the pool, depositing and withdrawing tokens, and more.

2. **How does the `unpack` function work in the `SwapInstruction` implementation?**

   The `unpack` function takes a byte buffer as input and attempts to convert it into a `SwapInstruction` instance. It does this by first reading the first byte of the buffer, which represents the instruction tag, and then parsing the rest of the buffer based on the tag to create the appropriate `SwapInstruction` variant.

3. **What is the purpose of the `pack` function in the `SwapInstruction` implementation?**

   The `pack` function is used to convert a `SwapInstruction` instance into a byte buffer. This is useful for serializing the instruction data to be sent over the network or stored on-chain. The function creates a new byte buffer, writes the instruction tag as the first byte, and then appends the data for each field in the instruction variant.
