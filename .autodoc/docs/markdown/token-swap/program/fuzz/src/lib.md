The code provided is part of the Solana Program Library, which contains a collection of on-chain programs that can be utilized by developers when building applications on the Solana blockchain. This specific file serves as a module declaration for four different modules: `native_account_data`, `native_processor`, `native_token`, and `native_token_swap`. Each of these modules is focused on a specific aspect of the Solana blockchain and can be used to interact with the native features of the platform.

1. `native_account_data`: This module deals with the native account data structure and provides functionality to interact with account data on the Solana blockchain. It may include methods for reading, writing, and updating account data, as well as handling account ownership and permissions.

2. `native_processor`: This module is responsible for processing transactions and instructions on the Solana blockchain. It may include methods for validating and executing transactions, handling cross-program invocations, and managing the execution of smart contracts.

3. `native_token`: This module focuses on the native token of the Solana blockchain, SOL. It provides functionality for handling token transfers, token balances, and other token-related operations. Developers can use this module to interact with the native SOL token when building their applications.

4. `native_token_swap`: This module deals with the token swap functionality on the Solana blockchain. It may include methods for creating and managing token swap pools, executing token swaps, and handling liquidity provision.

By importing and using these modules in their projects, developers can leverage the native features of the Solana blockchain and build powerful, scalable applications. For example, a developer might use the `native_token` module to transfer SOL tokens between accounts:

```rust
use solana_program_library::native_token::transfer;

// Transfer 10 SOL from account A to account B
transfer(account_a, account_b, 10_000_000_000);
```

Or, they might use the `native_token_swap` module to execute a token swap between two different tokens:

```rust
use solana_program_library::native_token_swap::swap;

// Swap 100 Token A for Token B
swap(token_a, token_b, 100_000_000);
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `#![allow(clippy::integer_arithmetic)]` line?**

   The `#![allow(clippy::integer_arithmetic)]` line is a directive to the Rust compiler to allow integer arithmetic without warnings from the Clippy linter. This is useful when the developer is confident that the arithmetic operations in the code are safe and do not need to be checked for potential issues like overflow or division by zero.

2. **What are the different modules being declared in this file?**

   The file declares four modules: `native_account_data`, `native_processor`, `native_token`, and `native_token_swap`. These modules likely contain code related to handling native account data, processing transactions, managing native tokens, and implementing token swaps, respectively.

3. **How can I use the functionality provided by these modules in my own code?**

   To use the functionality provided by these modules, you would need to import them into your own Rust code using the `use` keyword. For example, to import the `native_token` module, you would write `use solana_program_library::native_token;`. Then, you can access the functions and types defined in the module by using the module's name as a prefix, like `native_token::some_function()`.
