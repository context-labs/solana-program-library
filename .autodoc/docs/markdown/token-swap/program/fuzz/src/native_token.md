This code provides utility functions for creating and managing token accounts and mints in the Solana Program Library. It uses the `spl_token` crate for handling token state and the `solana_program` crate for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

The `create_mint` function creates a new token mint with the specified owner. It initializes a `Mint` struct with the given owner and packs it into a `NativeAccountData` object, which represents the on-chain account data.

```rust
pub fn create_mint(owner: &Pubkey) -> NativeAccountData;
```

The `create_token_account` function creates a new token account with the specified mint, owner, and initial token balance. It updates the mint's supply and packs the `TokenAccount` and updated `Mint` structs into their respective `NativeAccountData` objects.

```rust
pub fn create_token_account(
    mint_account: &mut NativeAccountData,
    owner: &Pubkey,
    amount: u64,
) -> NativeAccountData;
```

The `get_token_balance` function retrieves the token balance of a given token account by unpacking its `NativeAccountData` object and returning the `amount` field of the `TokenAccount` struct.

```rust
pub fn get_token_balance(account_data: &NativeAccountData) -> u64;
```

The `transfer` function transfers tokens between two token accounts. It ensures that both accounts have the same mint, updates their balances, and packs the updated `TokenAccount` structs back into their respective `NativeAccountData` objects.

```rust
pub fn transfer(
    from_account: &mut NativeAccountData,
    to_account: &mut NativeAccountData,
    amount: u64,
);
```

These utility functions can be used in the larger Solana Program Library project to create, manage, and interact with token accounts and mints on the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What does the `create_mint` function do and what are its input parameters?
   **Answer:** The `create_mint` function creates a new mint with the specified owner. It takes a reference to a `Pubkey` as its input parameter, which represents the owner of the mint.

2. **Question:** How does the `create_token_account` function work and what are its input parameters?
   **Answer:** The `create_token_account` function creates a new token account with the specified mint, owner, and initial amount. It takes a mutable reference to a `NativeAccountData` representing the mint account, a reference to a `Pubkey` representing the owner, and a `u64` value representing the initial amount of tokens.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `transfer` function and what are its input parameters?
   **Answer:** The `transfer` function transfers a specified amount of tokens from one account to another. It takes mutable references to two `NativeAccountData` objects representing the source and destination accounts, and a `u64` value representing the amount of tokens to transfer.
