The code in this file is part of the Solana Program Library and provides functionality for managing name registries on the Solana blockchain. Name registries are accounts that store metadata associated with a name, such as its owner, class, parent, and data. These registries can be used for various purposes, such as domain name systems, user profiles, or asset metadata.

The file exports several functions for interacting with name registries:

1. `createNameRegistry`: This function creates a new name registry with the specified parameters, such as the name, allocated space, owner, and class. It also handles rent budgeting and parent name ownership. Example usage:

   ```javascript
   const createInstruction = await createNameRegistry(connection, name, space, payerKey, nameOwner);
   ```

2. `updateNameRegistryData`: This function updates the data stored in a name registry at a specified offset. It requires the name, offset, input data, and optionally the name class and parent. Example usage:

   ```javascript
   const updateInstruction = await updateNameRegistryData(connection, name, offset, inputData);
   ```

3. `transferNameOwnership`: This function transfers the ownership of a name registry to a new owner. It requires the name, new owner, and optionally the name class and parent. Example usage:

   ```javascript
   const transferInstruction = await transferNameOwnership(connection, name, newOwner);
   ```

4. `deleteNameRegistry`: This function deletes a name registry and transfers the rent to a specified target. It requires the name, refund target, and optionally the name class and parent. Example usage:

   ```javascript
   const deleteInstruction = await deleteNameRegistry(connection, name, refundTargetKey);
   ```

5. `reallocNameAccount`: This function reallocates the space of a name registry. It requires the name, new space, payer key, and optionally the name class and parent. Example usage:

   ```javascript
   const reallocInstruction = await reallocNameAccount(connection, name, space, payerKey);
   ```

These functions return `TransactionInstruction` objects, which can be used to build and sign transactions for submission to the Solana network.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `NAME_PROGRAM_ID` and `HASH_PREFIX` constants?
   **Answer**: The `NAME_PROGRAM_ID` is a public key representing the program ID for the Solana Name Service, while `HASH_PREFIX` is a string used as a prefix for hashing the name in the name registry.

2. **Question**: How does the `createNameRegistry` function work and what are its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `createNameRegistry` function creates a new name account with the given rent budget, allocated space, owner, and class. It takes the following parameters: `connection`, `name`, `space`, `payerKey`, `nameOwner`, `lamports`, `nameClass`, and `parentName`.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `updateNameRegistryData` function and what are its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `updateNameRegistryData` function is used to overwrite the data of a given name registry. It takes the following parameters: `connection`, `name`, `offset`, `input_data`, `nameClass`, and `nameParent`.
