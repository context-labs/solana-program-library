This code defines the structure and behavior of a Feature Proposal account in the Solana Program Library. A Feature Proposal account represents a proposal for a new feature that can be accepted or rejected based on certain criteria. The code defines two main structures: `AcceptanceCriteria` and `FeatureProposal`.

`AcceptanceCriteria` is a structure that defines the criteria for accepting a feature proposal. It has two fields:
- `tokens_required`: The minimum number of tokens that must be present in the feature proposal's token account for the proposal to be accepted.
- `deadline`: A Unix timestamp representing the deadline for the proposal. If the required tokens are not tallied by this deadline, the proposal will expire.

`FeatureProposal` is an enumeration that represents the state of a feature proposal account. It has four possible states:
- `Uninitialized`: The default state after creating the account.
- `Pending`: The proposal is pending and waiting for acceptance. This state contains an `AcceptanceCriteria` object.
- `Accepted`: The proposal has been accepted and the feature is now active. This state contains a field `tokens_upon_acceptance` which stores the balance of the feature proposal's token account at the time of activation.
- `Expired`: The proposal was not accepted before the deadline.

The `FeatureProposal` enumeration implements the `Pack` and `Sealed` traits, which allow it to be serialized and deserialized for storage in Solana accounts. The code also includes tests to ensure the correct behavior of the serialization and deserialization functions.

In the larger project, this code can be used to manage feature proposals and their acceptance criteria. Users can create new proposals, update their state based on the acceptance criteria, and activate or expire them as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `AcceptanceCriteria` struct and its fields?
   **Answer**: The `AcceptanceCriteria` struct represents the criteria for accepting a feature proposal. It has two fields: `tokens_required`, which specifies the minimum balance of the feature proposal's token account, and `deadline`, which is a Unix timestamp indicating the deadline for the proposal to be accepted.

2. **Question**: How does the `FeatureProposal` enum represent the different states of a feature proposal?
   **Answer**: The `FeatureProposal` enum has four variants: `Uninitialized`, `Pending`, `Accepted`, and `Expired`. Each variant represents a different state of a feature proposal, such as being uninitialized, pending with acceptance criteria, accepted with the token balance at the time of acceptance, or expired due to not meeting the acceptance criteria before the deadline.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Pack` trait implementation for `FeatureProposal`?
   **Answer**: The `Pack` trait implementation for `FeatureProposal` allows the enum to be serialized and deserialized into a byte slice. This is useful for storing and retrieving the feature proposal data from the Solana program's account data.
