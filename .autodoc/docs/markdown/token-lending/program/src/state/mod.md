This code defines the state types and constants for the Solana Program Library's lending market module. The lending market module is responsible for managing the lending and borrowing of tokens on the Solana blockchain. The code is organized into four sub-modules: `last_update`, `lending_market`, `obligation`, and `reserve`. Each sub-module contains the necessary data structures and functions for managing the respective components of the lending market.

The `INITIAL_COLLATERAL_RATIO` constant is set to 1, which means that collateral tokens are initially valued at a 1:1 ratio with liquidity tokens. This value can be adjusted as needed. The `PROGRAM_VERSION` constant is set to 1, which represents the current version of the program. The `UNINITIALIZED_VERSION` constant is set to 0, which is used to identify uninitialized state instances. The `SLOTS_PER_YEAR` constant calculates the number of slots per year based on the default ticks per second, ticks per slot, and seconds per day.

The code also provides helper functions for packing and unpacking `Decimal` and `bool` values. These functions are used to store and retrieve data from the Solana blockchain. The `pack_decimal` and `unpack_decimal` functions convert `Decimal` values to and from their scaled representation, while the `pack_bool` and `unpack_bool` functions convert `bool` values to and from their byte representation.

The test module at the end of the code ensures that the `INITIAL_COLLATERAL_RATE` is calculated correctly based on the `INITIAL_COLLATERAL_RATIO` and the `WAD` constant.

Overall, this code provides the foundation for managing the state of the lending market module in the Solana Program Library. The sub-modules handle the various components of the lending market, while the constants and helper functions provide a consistent way to interact with the data stored on the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `INITIAL_COLLATERAL_RATIO` constant and why is there a comment to restore it to 5?
   **Answer**: The `INITIAL_COLLATERAL_RATIO` constant is used to set the initial value of collateral tokens in relation to liquidity tokens at a 5:1 ratio. The comment suggests that the value should be restored to 5, possibly indicating that it was temporarily changed to 1 for testing or development purposes.

2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `pack_decimal` and `unpack_decimal` functions?
   **Answer**: The `pack_decimal` and `unpack_decimal` functions are helper functions used to convert a `Decimal` value to a byte array and vice versa. This is useful for storing and retrieving decimal values in a compact binary format.

3. **Question**: How is the `SLOTS_PER_YEAR` constant calculated and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `SLOTS_PER_YEAR` constant is calculated by dividing the default ticks per second by the default ticks per slot, then multiplying by the number of seconds per day and the number of days in a year. This constant is used to represent the number of slots in a year, which can be useful for calculations involving time-based interest rates or other time-dependent financial operations.
