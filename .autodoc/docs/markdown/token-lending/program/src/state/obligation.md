The `Obligation` struct represents the state of a lending market obligation in the Solana Program Library. It contains information about the collateral deposited, liquidity borrowed, and the market values of both. The struct also includes the lending market address, owner pubkey, and other related values.

The `Obligation` struct provides methods to create and initialize a new obligation, calculate the loan-to-value ratio, repay liquidity, withdraw collateral, and find or add collateral and liquidity to the obligation. It also provides methods to calculate the maximum withdrawal and borrow values, as well as the maximum liquidation amount for a given liquidity.

The `ObligationCollateral` and `ObligationLiquidity` structs represent the state of collateral and liquidity in an obligation, respectively. They both contain the reserve address, amount, and market value. The `ObligationCollateral` struct provides methods to deposit and withdraw collateral, while the `ObligationLiquidity` struct provides methods to repay and borrow liquidity, as well as accrue interest.

Example usage:

```rust
// Create a new obligation
let obligation = Obligation::new(InitObligationParams {
    current_slot: 0,
    lending_market: Pubkey::new_unique(),
    owner: Pubkey::new_unique(),
    deposits: vec![],
    borrows: vec![],
});

// Initialize an obligation
obligation.init(InitObligationParams {
    current_slot: 0,
    lending_market: Pubkey::new_unique(),
    owner: Pubkey::new_unique(),
    deposits: vec![],
    borrows: vec![],
});

// Calculate the loan-to-value ratio
let ltv = obligation.loan_to_value()?;

// Repay liquidity
obligation.repay(Decimal::from(100), 0)?;

// Withdraw collateral
obligation.withdraw(100, 0)?;
```

The `Obligation` struct implements the `Pack` trait, which allows it to be serialized and deserialized to and from byte slices. This is useful for storing the obligation state in Solana accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Obligation` struct and its associated methods?

   **Answer**: The `Obligation` struct represents the state of a lending market obligation, including information about the deposited collateral, borrowed liquidity, and their market values. The associated methods provide functionality for initializing, updating, and managing the obligation, such as calculating loan-to-value ratios, repaying borrowed liquidity, and withdrawing collateral.

2. **Question**: What is the maximum number of collateral and liquidity reserve accounts combined for an obligation?

   **Answer**: The maximum number of collateral and liquidity reserve accounts combined for an obligation is defined by the constant `MAX_OBLIGATION_RESERVES`, which is set to 10.

3. **Question**: How does the `accrue_interest` method work in the `ObligationLiquidity` struct?

   **Answer**: The `accrue_interest` method takes a new cumulative borrow rate as input and updates the borrowed amount and cumulative borrow rate of the `ObligationLiquidity` based on the new rate. If the new rate is greater than the current rate, the borrowed amount is increased according to the compounded interest rate. If the new rate is equal to or less than the current rate, the borrowed amount remains unchanged.
